Synergy
=======

We now commit directly to release branches. The trunk was becoming a dead
weight (as it was always the same as the latest release branch), so we
deleted it.

Please commit to (and build patches against) the a release branch.
e.g. /branches/1.4

If you have any questions, please email the dev mailing list.
