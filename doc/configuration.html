<p>
</p><h3>Synergy Configuration File Format</h3><p>
</p><p>
The synergy server requires configuration.  It will try certain
pathnames to load the configuration file if you don't specify a
path using the <span class="code">--config</span> command line
option.  <span class="code">synergys --help</span> reports those
pathnames.
</p><p>
The configuration file is a plain text file.  Use any text editor
to create the configuration file.  The file is broken into sections
and each section has the form:
<span class="codeblock">
  section: <span class="arg">name</span>
    <span class="arg">args</span>
  end
</span>
Comments are introduced by <span class="code">#</span> and continue to
the end of the line.  <span class="arg">name</span> must be one of the
following:
<ul class="code">
<li>screens
<li>aliases
<li>links
<li>options
</ul>
See below for further explanation of each section type.  The
configuration file is case-sensitive so <span class="code">Section</span>,
<span class="code">SECTION</span>, and <span class="code">section</span>
are all different and only the last is valid.  Screen names are the
exception;  screen names are case-insensitive.
</p><p>
The file is parsed top to bottom and names cannot be used before
they've been defined in the <span class="code">screens</span> or
<span class="code">aliases</span> sections.  So the
<span class="code">links</span> and <span class="code">aliases</span>
must appear after the <span class="code">screens</span> and links
cannot refer to aliases unless the <span class="code">aliases</span>
appear before the <span class="code">links</span>.
</p><p>
</p><h4>screens</h4><p>
</p><p>
<span class="arg">args</span> is a list of screen names, one name per
line, each followed by a colon.  Names are arbitrary strings but they
must be unique.  The hostname of each computer is recommended.  (This
is the computer's network name on win32 and the name reported by the
program <span class="code">hostname</span> on Unix and OS X.  Note
that OS X may append <span class="code">.local</span> to the name you
gave your computer; e.g. <span class="code">somehost.local</span>.)
There must be a screen name for the server and each client.  Each
screen can specify a number of options.  Options have the form
<span class="code"><span class="arg">name</span> =
<span class="arg">value</span></span> and are listed one per line
after the screen name.
</p><p>
Example:
<span class="codeblock">
    section: screens
     moe:
     larry:
            halfDuplexCapsLock = true
            halfDuplexNumLock = true
     curly:
            meta = alt
    end
</span>
This declares three screens named <span class="code">moe</span>,
<span class="code">larry</span>, and <span class="code">curly</span>.
Screen <span class="code">larry</span> has half-duplex Caps Lock and
Num Lock keys (see below) and screen <span class="code">curly</span>
converts the meta modifier key to the alt modifier key.
</p><p>
A screen can have the following options:
<ul>
<li><span class="code">halfDuplexCapsLock = {true|false}</span>
</p><p>
        This computer has a Caps Lock key that doesn't report a
        press and a release event when the user presses it but
        instead reports a press event when it's turned on and a
        release event when it's turned off.  If Caps Lock acts
        strangely on all screens then you may need to set this
        option to <span class="code">true</span>
        on the server screen.  If it acts strangely on one
        screen then that screen may need the option set to
        <span class="code">true</span>.
</p><p>
<li><span class="code">halfDuplexNumLock = {true|false}</span>
</p><p>
        This is identical to <span class="code">halfDuplexCapsLock</span>
        except it applies to the Num Lock key.
</p><p>
<li><span class="code">halfDuplexScrollLock = {true|false}</span>
</p><p>
        This is identical to <span class="code">halfDuplexCapsLock</span>
        except it applies to the Scroll Lock key.  Note that, by default,
  synergy uses Scroll Lock to keep the cursor on the current screen.  That
  is, when Scroll Lock is toggled on, the cursor is locked to the screen
  that it's currently on.  You can use that to prevent accidental switching.
  You can also configure other hot keys to do that; see <a href="#lockCursor">
  lockCursorToScreen</a>.
</p><p>
<li><span class="code">switchCorners = &lt;corners&gt;</span>
</p><p>
  See <a href="#corners">switchCorners</a> below.
</p><p>
<li><span class="code">switchCornerSize = N</span>
</p><p>
  See <a href="#cornerSize">switchCornerSize</a> below.
</p><p>
<li><span class="code">xtestIsXineramaUnaware = {true|false}</span>
</p><p>
        This option works around a bug in the XTest extension
        when used in combination with Xinerama.  It affects
        X11 clients only.  Not all versions of the XTest
        extension are aware of the Xinerama extension.  As a
        result, they do not move the mouse correctly when
        using multiple Xinerama screens.  This option is
        currently <span class="code">true</span> by default.  If
        you know your XTest extension is Xinerama aware then set
        this option to <span class="code">false</span>.
</p><p>
<li><span class="code">shift = {shift|ctrl|alt|meta|super|none}<br>
      ctrl  = {shift|ctrl|alt|meta|super|none}<br>
      alt   = {shift|ctrl|alt|meta|super|none}<br>
      meta  = {shift|ctrl|alt|meta|super|none}<br>
      super = {shift|ctrl|alt|meta|super|none}</span>
</p><p>
        Map a modifier key pressed on the server's keyboard to
        a different modifier on this client.  This option only
        has an effect on a client screen;  it's accepted and
        ignored on the server screen.
</p><p>
        You can map, say, the shift key to shift (the default),
     ctrl, alt, meta, super or nothing.  Normally, you
        wouldn't remap shift or ctrl.  You might, however, have
        an X11 server with meta bound to the Alt keys.  To use
        this server effectively with a windows client, which
        doesn't use meta but uses alt extensively, you'll want
        the windows client to map meta to alt (using
        <span class="code">meta = alt</span>).
</p><p>
</ul>
</p><p>
</p><a name="aliases"></a><h4>aliases</h4><p>
</p><p>
    <span class="arg">args</span> is a list of screen names just like
    in the <span class="code">screens</span> section except each screen
    is followed by a list of aliases, one per line, <b>not</b> followed
    by a colon.  An alias is a screen name and must be unique.  During
    screen name lookup each alias is equivalent to the screen name it
    aliases.  So a client can connect using its canonical screen name
    or any of its aliases.  
</p><p>
    Example:
<span class="codeblock">
    section: aliases
        larry:
            larry.stooges.com
        curly:
            shemp
    end
</span>
    Screen <span class="code">larry</span> is also known as
 <span class="code">larry.stooges.com</span> and can connect as
    either name.  Screen <span class="code">curly</span> is also
    known as <span class="code">shemp</span> (hey, it's just an example).
</p><p>
</p><h4>links</h4><p>
</p><p>
    <span class="arg">args</span> is a list of screen names just like
    in the <span class="code">screens</span> section except each screen
    is followed by a list of links, one per line.  Each link has the
    form <span class="code">{left|right|up|down}[&lt;range&gt;]</span> =
    <span class="code">name[&lt;range&gt;]</span>.  A link indicates which
    screen is adjacent in the given direction.
</p><p>
    Each side of a link can specify a range which defines a portion
    of an edge.  A range on the direction is the portion of edge you can
    leave from while a range on the screen is the portion of edge you'll
    enter into.  Ranges are optional and default to the entire edge.  All
    ranges on a particular direction of a particular screen must not
    overlap.
</p><p>
    A &lt;range&gt; is written as <span class="code">(&lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt;)</span>.
    Both <span class="code">start</span> and <span class="code">end</span>
    are percentages in the range 0 to 100, inclusive.  The start must be
    less than the end.  0 is the left or top of an edge and 100 is the
    right or bottom.
</p><p>
    Example:
<span class="codeblock">
    section: links
        moe:
            right        = larry
            up(50,100)   = curly(0,50)
        larry:
            left         = moe
            up(0,50)     = curly(50,100)
        curly:
            down(0,50)   = moe
            down(50,100) = larry(0,50)
    end
</span>
    This indicates that screen <span class="code">larry</span> is to
    the right of screen <span class="code">moe</span> (so moving the
    cursor off the right edge of <span class="code">moe</span> would
    make it appear at the left edge of <span class="code">larry</span>),
    the left half of
    <span class="code">curly</span> is above the right half of
    <span class="code">moe</span>,
    <span class="code">moe</span> is to the left of
    <span class="code">larry</span> (edges are not necessarily symmetric
    so you have to provide both directions), the right half of
    <span class="code">curly</span> is above the left half of
    <span class="code">larry</span>, all of <span class="code">moe</span>
    is below the left half of <span class="code">curly</span>, and the
    left half of <span class="code">larry</span> is below the right half of
    <span class="code">curly</span>.
</p><p>
    <a name="asymmetric"></a>Note that links do not have to be
    symmetrical;  for instance, here the edge between
    <span class="code">moe</span> and <span class="code">curly</span>
    maps to different ranges depending on if you're going up or down.
    In fact links don't have to be bidirectional.  You can configure
    the right of <span class="code">moe</span> to go to
    <span class="code">larry</span> without a link from the left of
    <span class="code">larry</span> to <span class="code">moe</span>.
    It's possible to configure a screen with no outgoing links;  the
    cursor will get stuck on that screen unless you have a hot key
    configured to switch off of that screen.
</p><p>
</p><h4>options</h4><p>
</p><p>
    <span class="arg">args</span> is a list of lines of the form
    <span class="code">name = value</span>.  These set the global
    options.
</p><p>
    Example:
<span class="codeblock">
    section: options
        heartbeat = 5000
        switchDelay = 500
    end
</span>
</p><p>
    You can use the following options:
<ul>
<li><span class="code">heartbeat = N</span>
</p><p>
        The server will expect each client to send a message no
        less than every <span class="code">N</span> milliseconds.
        If no message arrives from a client within
        <span class="code">3N</span> seconds the server forces that
        client to disconnect.
</p><p>
        If synergy fails to detect clients disconnecting while
        the server is sleeping or vice versa, try using this
        option.
</p><p>
<li><span class="code"><a name="corners"></a>switchCorners = &lt;corners&gt;</span>
</p><p>
  Synergy won't switch screens when the mouse reaches the edge of
  the screen if it's in a listed corner.  The size of all corners
  is given by the <span class="code">switchCornerSize</span>
  option.
</p><p>
  Corners are specified by a list using the following names:
  <ul>
  <li><span class="code">none</span> -- no corners
  <li><span class="code">top-left</span> -- the top left corner
  <li><span class="code">top-right</span> -- the top right corner
  <li><span class="code">bottom-left</span> -- the bottom left corner
  <li><span class="code">bottom-right</span> -- the bottom right corner
  <li><span class="code">left</span> -- top and bottom left corners
  <li><span class="code">right</span> -- top and bottom right corners
  <li><span class="code">top</span> -- left and right top corners
  <li><span class="code">bottom</span> -- left and right bottom corners
  <li><span class="code">all</span> -- all corners
  </ul>
</p><p>
  The first name in the list is one of the above names and defines
  the initial set of corners.  Subsequent names are prefixed with
  + or - to add the corner to or remove the corner from the set,
  respectively.  For example:
</p><p>
  <span class="code">
   all -left +top-left
  </span>
</p><p>
  starts will all corners, removes the left corners (top and bottom)
  then adds the top-left back in, resulting in the top-left,
  bottom-left and bottom-right corners.
</p><p>
<li><span class="code"><a name="cornerSize"></a>switchCornerSize = N</span>
</p><p>
  Sets the size of all corners in pixels.  The cursor must be within
  <span class="code">N</span> pixels of the corner to be considered
  to be in the corner.
</p><p>
<li><span class="code">switchDelay = N</span>
</p><p>
        Synergy won't switch screens when the mouse reaches the
        edge of a screen unless it stays on the edge for
        <span class="code">N</span>
        milliseconds.  This helps prevent unintentional
        switching when working near the edge of a screen.
</p><p>
<li><span class="code">switchDoubleTap = N</span>
</p><p>
        Synergy won't switch screens when the mouse reaches the
        edge of a screen unless it's moved away from the edge
        and then back to the edge within <span class="code">N</span>
        milliseconds.  With
        the option you have to quickly tap the edge twice to
        switch.  This helps prevent unintentional switching
        when working near the edge of a screen.
</p><p>
<li><span class="code">screenSaverSync = {true|false}</span>
</p><p>
  If set to <span class="code">false</span> then synergy
  won't synchronize screen savers.  Client screen savers
  will start according to their individual configurations. 
  The server screen saver won't start if there is input,
  even if that input is directed toward a client screen.
</p><p>
<li><span class="code">relativeMouseMoves = {true|false}</span>
</p><p>
  If set to <span class="code">true</span> then secondary
  screens move the mouse using relative rather than absolute
  mouse moves when and only when the cursor is locked to the
  screen (by Scroll Lock or a <a href="#lockCursor">configured
  hot key</a>).
  This is intended to make synergy work better with certain
  games.  If set to <span class="code">false</span> or not
  set then all mouse moves are absolute.
</p><p>
<li><span class="code">keystroke(<span class="arg">key</span>) = <span class="arg">actions</span></span>
</p><p>
  Binds the key combination <span class="arg">key</span> to the
  given <span class="arg">actions</span>.  <span class="arg">key</span>
  is an optional list of modifiers (<span class="code">shift</span>,
  <span class="code">control</span>, <span class="code">alt</span>,
  <span class="code">meta</span> or <span class="code">super</span>)
  optionally followed by a character or a key name, all separated by
  <span class="code">+</span> (plus signs).  You must have either
  modifiers or a character/key name or both.  See below for
  <a href="#keynames">valid key names</a>.
</p><p>
  Actions are described <a href="#actions">below</a>.
</p><p>
  Keyboard hot keys are handled while the cursor is on the primary
  screen and secondary screens.  Separate actions can be assigned
  to press and release.
</p><p>
<li><span class="code">mousebutton(<span class="arg">button</span>) = <span class="arg">actions</span></span>
</p><p>
  Binds the modifier and mouse button combination
  <span class="arg">button</span> to the given
  <span class="arg">actions</span>.  <span class="arg">button</span>
  is an optional list of modifiers (<span class="code">shift</span>,
  <span class="code">control</span>, <span class="code">alt</span>,
  <span class="code">meta</span> or <span class="code">super</span>)
  followed by a button number.  The primary button (the
  left button for right handed users) is button 1, the middle button
  is 2, etc.
</p><p>
  Actions are described <a href="#actions">below</a>.
</p><p>
  Mouse button actions are not handled while the cursor is on the
  primary screen.  You cannot use these to perform an action while
  on the primary screen.  Separate actions can be assigned to press
  and release.
</p><p>
</ul>
    You can use both the <span class="code">switchDelay</span> and
    <span class="code">switchDoubleTap</span> options at the same
    time.  Synergy will switch when either requirement is satisfied.
</p><p>
<a name="actions">Actions</a> are two lists of individual actions separated
by commas.  The two lists are separated by a semicolon.  Either list can be
empty and if the second list is empty then the semicolon is optional.  The
first list lists actions to take when the condition becomes true (e.g. the
hot key or mouse button is pressed) and the second lists actions to take
when the condition becomes false (e.g. the hot key or button is released).
The condition becoming true is called activation and becoming false is
called deactivation.
Allowed individual actions are:
<ul>
<li><span class="code">keystroke(<span class="arg">key</span>[,<span class="arg">screens</span>])</span>
<li><span class="code">keyDown(<span class="arg">key</span>[,<span class="arg">screens</span>])</span>
<li><span class="code">keyUp(<span class="arg">key</span>[,<span class="arg">screens</span>])</span>
</p><p>
  Synthesizes the modifiers and key given in <span class="arg">key</span>
  which has the same form as described in the
  <span class="code">keystroke</span> option.  If given,
  <span class="arg">screens</span> lists the screen or screens to
  direct the event to, regardless of the active screen.  If not
  given then the event is directed to the active screen only.
  (Due to a bug, keys cannot be directed to the server while on a
  client screen.)
</p><p>
  <span class="code">keyDown</span> synthesizes a key press and
  <span class="code">keyUp</span> synthesizes a key release.
  <span class="code">keystroke</span> synthesizes a key press on
  activation and a release on deactivation and is equivalent to
  a <span class="code">keyDown</span> on activation and
  <span class="code">keyUp</span> on deactivation.
</p><p>
  <span class="arg">screens</span> is either <span class="code">*</span>
  to indicate all screens or a colon (:) separated list of screen
  names.  (Note that the screen name must have already been encountered
  in the configuration file so you'll probably want to put actions at
  the bottom of the file.)
</p><p>
<li><span class="code">mousebutton(<span class="arg">button</span>)</span>
<li><span class="code">mouseDown(<span class="arg">button</span>)</span>
<li><span class="code">mouseUp(<span class="arg">button</span>)</span>
</p><p>
  Synthesizes the modifiers and mouse button given in
  <span class="arg">button</span>
  which has the same form as described in the
  <span class="code">mousebutton</span> option.
</p><p>
  <span class="code">mouseDown</span> synthesizes a mouse press and
  <span class="code">mouseUp</span> synthesizes a mouse release.
  <span class="code">mousebutton</span> synthesizes a mouse press on
  activation and a release on deactivation and is equivalent to
  a <span class="code">mouseDown</span> on activation and
  <span class="code">mouseUp</span> on deactivation.
</p><p>
<li><a name="lockCursor"></a><span class="code">lockCursorToScreen(<span class="arg">mode</span>)</span>
</p><p>
  Locks the cursor to or unlocks the cursor from the active screen.
  <span class="arg">mode</span> can be <span class="code">off</span>
  to unlock the cursor, <span class="code">on</span> to lock the
  cursor, or <span class="code">toggle</span> to toggle the current
  state.  The default is <span class="code">toggle</span>.  If the
  configuration has no <span class="code">lockCursorToScreen</span>
  action and Scroll Lock is not used as a hot key then Scroll Lock
  toggles cursor locking.
</p><p>
<li><span class="code">switchToScreen(<span class="arg">screen</span>)</span>
</p><p>
  Jump to screen with name or alias <span class="arg">screen</span>.
</p><p>
<li><span class="code">switchInDirection(<span class="arg">dir</span>)</span>
</p><p>
  Switch to the screen in the direction <span class="arg">dir</span>,
  which may be one of <span class="code">left</span>,
  <span class="code">right</span>, <span class="code">up</span> or
  <span class="code">down</span>.
</p><p>
<li><a name="keyboardBroadcast"></a><span class="code">keyboardBroadcast(<span class="arg">mode</span>[,<span class="arg">screens</span>])</span>
</p><p>
  Turns broadcasting of keystrokes to multiple screens on and off.  When
  turned on all key presses and releases are sent to all of the screens
  listed in <span class="arg">screens</span>.  If not given, empty or
  <span class="code">*</span> then keystrokes are broadcast to all screens.
  (However, due to a bug, keys cannot be sent to the server while on a
  client screen.)
</p><p>
  <span class="arg">mode</span> can be <span class="code">off</span>
  to turn broadcasting off, <span class="code">on</span> to turn it
  on, or <span class="code">toggle</span> to toggle the current
  state.  The default is <span class="code">toggle</span>.
</p><p>
  <span class="arg">screens</span> is either <span class="code">*</span>
  to indicate all screens or a colon (:) separated list of screen
  names.  (Note that the screen name must have already been encountered
  in the configuration file so you'll probably want to put actions at
  the bottom of the file.)
</p><p>
  Multiple <span class="code">keyboardBroadcast</span> actions may be
  configured with different <span class="arg">screens</span>.  The most
  recently performed action defines the screens to broadcast to.
</p><p>
</ul>
</p><p>
Examples:
<ul>
<li><span class="code">keystroke(alt+left) = switchInDirection(left)</span>
</p><p>
 Switches to the screen to left when the left arrow key is pressed
 in combination with the Alt key.
</p><p>
<li><span class="code">keystroke(shift+control+alt+super) = switchToScreen(moe)</span>
</p><p>
 Switches to screen <span class="code">moe</span> when all of the
 Shift, Control, Alt, and Super modifier keys are pressed together.
</p><p>
<li><span class="code">keystroke(alt+f1) = ; lockCursorToScreen(toggle)</span>
</p><p>
 Toggles locking the cursor to the screen when Alt+F1 is released.
</p><p>
<li><span class="code">mousebutton(2) = mouseDown(control+1) ; mouseUp(control+1)</span>
</p><p>
 While on a secondary screen clicking the middle mouse button will
 become a Control click of the primary button.
</p><p>
<li><span class="code">keystroke(super+f1) = keystroke(super+L,larry), keystroke(control+alt+delete,curly)</span>
</p><p>
 Pressing Super+F1 (on any screen) will synthesize Super+L on screen
 <span class="code">larry</span> and Control+Alt+Delete on screen
 <span class="code">curly</span>.
</p><p>
</ul></span>
</p><p>
