</p><h3>Synergy History</h3><p>
</p><p>
The first incarnation of synergy was CosmoSynergy, created by
Richard Lee and Adam Feder then at Cosmo Software, Inc., a
subsidiary of SGI (nee Silicon Graphics, Inc.), at the end of
1996.  They wrote it, and Chris Schoeneman contributed, to
solve a problem:  most of the engineers in Cosmo Software had
both an Irix and a Windows box on their desks and switchboxes
were expensive and annoying.  CosmoSynergy was a great success
but Cosmo Software declined to productize it and the company
was later closed.
</p><p>
Synergy is a from-scratch reimplementation of CosmoSynergy.
It provides most of the features of the original and adds a
few improvements.
