</p><h4>Introduction</h4><p>
synergy: [noun] a mutually advantageous conjunction of distinct elements
</p><p>
Synergy lets you easily share a single mouse and keyboard between
multiple computers with different operating systems, each with its
own display, without special hardware.  It's intended for users
with multiple computers on their desk since each system uses its
own monitor(s).
</p><p>
Redirecting the mouse and keyboard is as simple as moving the mouse
off the edge of your screen.  Synergy also merges the clipboards of
all the systems into one, allowing cut-and-paste between systems.
Furthermore, it synchronizes screen savers so they all start and stop
together and, if screen locking is enabled, only one screen requires
a password to unlock them all.  <a href="about.html">Learn more</a>
about how it works.
</p><p>
Synergy is open source and released under the
<a href="license.html#GPL">GNU Public License (GPL)</a>.
</p><p>
</p><h4>System Requirements</h4><p>
</p><p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me (the Windows 95 family)
<li>Microsoft Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP (the Windows NT family)
<li>Mac OS X 10.2 or higher
<li>Unix
  <ul>
  <li>X Windows version 11 revision 4 or up
  <li>XTEST extension<br>
    (use "<span class="code">xdpyinfo | grep XTEST</span>" to check for XTEST)
  </ul>
</ul>
All systems must support TCP/IP networking.
</p><p>
"Unix" includes Linux, Solaris, Irix and other variants.  Synergy has
only been extensively tested on Linux and may not work completely or
at all on other versions of Unix.  Patches are welcome (including
patches that package binaries) at the
<a target="_top" href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=59275&atid=490469">patches page</a>.
</p><p>
The Mac OS X port is incomplete.  It does not synchronize the screen saver,
only text clipboard data works (i.e. HTML and bitmap data do not work),
the cursor won't hide when not on the screen, and there may be problems
with mouse wheel acceleration.  Other problems should be
<a target="_top" href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=add&group_id=59275&atid=490467">filed as bugs</a>.
