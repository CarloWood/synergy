</p><h3>Authentication and Encryption</h3><p>
Synergy does not do any authentication or encryption.  Any computer
can connect to the synergy server if it provides a screen name known
to the server, and all data is transferred between the server and the
clients unencrypted which means that anyone can, say, extract the
key presses used to type a password.  Therefore, synergy should not
be used on untrusted networks.
</p><p>
However, there are tools that can add authentication and encryption
to synergy without modifying either those tools or synergy.  One
such tool is SSH (which stands for secure shell).  A free implementation
of SSH is called <a target="_top" href="http://www.openssh.com/">OpenSSH</a> and runs
on Linux, many Unixes, and Windows (in combination with
<a target="_top" href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>).
</p><p>
</p><h3>Configuring the Server</h3><p>
Install the OpenSSH server on the same computer as the synergy server.
Configure the OpenSSH server as usual (synergy doesn't demand any
special options in OpenSSH) and start it.  Start the synergy server as
usual;  the synergy server requires no special options to work with
OpenSSH.
</p><p>
</p><h3>Configuring the Clients</h3><p>
Install the OpenSSH client on each synergy client computer.  Then, on
each client, start the OpenSSH client using port forwarding:
<pre>
  ssh -f -N -L 24800:<span class="arg">server-hostname</span>:24800 <span class="arg">server-hostname</span>
</pre>
The <span class="arg">server-hostname</span> is the name or address
of the computer with the OpenSSH and synergy servers.
The 24800 is the default network port used by synergy;  if you use
a different port then replace both instances of 24800 with the port
number that you use.  Finally, start the synergy client normally
except use <span class="code">localhost</span> as the server host
name.  For example:
<pre>
  synergyc -f localhost
</pre>
Synergy will then run normally except all communication is passed
through OpenSSH which decrypts/encrypts it on behalf of synergy.
