</p><h3>Tips and Tricks</h3><p>
<ul>
<li>
  Be aware that not all keystrokes can be handled by synergy.  In
  particular, ctrl+alt+del is not handled.  However, synergy can
  convert ctrl+alt+pause into ctrl+alt+del on the client side.
  (Synergy must be configured to autostart when the computer starts
  on the client for this to work on the Windows NT family.)  Some
  non-standard keys may not work, especially "multimedia" buttons,
  though several are correctly handled.
</p><p>
<li>
  A screen can be its own neighbor.  That allows a screen to "wrap".
  For example, if a configuration linked the left and right sides of
  a screen to itself then moving off the left of the screen would put
  the mouse at the right of the screen and vice versa.
</p><p>
<li>
  You cannot switch screens when the Scroll Lock is toggled on.  Use
  this to prevent unintentional switching.  You can configure other
  hot keys to do this instead;  see
  <a href="configuration.html#lockCursor">lockCursorToScreen</a>.
</p><p>
<li>
  Turn off mouse driven virtual desktop switching on X windows.  It
  will interfere with synergy.  Use keyboard shortcuts instead.
</p><p>
<li>
  Synergy's screen saver synchronization works best with xscreensaver
  under X windows.  Synergy works better with xscreensaver if it is
  using one of the screen saver extensions.  Prior to xscreensaver 4.0
  you can use <span class="code">-mit-extension</span>,
  <span class="code">-sgi-extension</span>, or
  <span class="code">-xidle-extension</span>
  command line options to enable an extension (assuming your server has
  the extension).  Starting with 4.0 you must enable the corresponding
  option in your <span class="code">.xscreensaver</span> file.
</p><p>
<li>
  Synergy automatically converts newlines in clipboard text (Unix
  expects <span class="code">\n</span> to end each line while Windows
  expects <span class="code">\r\n</span>).
</p><p>
<li>
  Clients can be started and stopped at any time.  When a screen is
  not connected, the mouse will jump over that screen as if the mouse
  had moved all the way across it and jumped to the next screen.
</p><p>
<li>
  A client's keyboard and mouse are fully functional while synergy is
  running.  You can use them in case synergy locks up.
</p><p>
<li>
  Strong authentication and encryption is available by using SSH.  See
  the <a href="security.html">security guide</a> for more information.
  Synergy does not otherwise provide secure communications and it should
  not be used on or over untrusted networks.
</p><p>
<li>
  Synergy doesn't work if a 16-bit Windows application has the focus
  on Windows 95/98/Me.  This is due to limitations of Windows.  One
  commonly used 16-bit application is the command prompt
  (<span class="code">command.exe</span>)
  and this includes synergy's log window when running in test mode.
