<h3>Synergy To Do List</h3>
<p>
This page describes the planned development of Synergy.  There are
no dates or deadlines.  Instead, you'll find the features to come
and the rough order they can be expected to arrive.
</p>

<h4>Short term</h4>
<p>
Synergy should work seamlessly.  When it works correctly, it works
transparently so you don't even think about it.  When it breaks,
you're forced out of the illusion of a unified desktop.  The first
priority is fixing those bugs that break the illusion.
</p>
<p>
Some of these bugs are pretty minor and some people would rather
have new features first.  But I'd rather fix the current
foundation before building on it.  That's not to say features
won't get added until after bug fixes;  sometimes it's just too
tempting to code up a feature.
</p>

<h4>Medium term</h4>
<p>
Some features fit well into Synergy's current design and may simply
enhance it's current capabilities.
<ul>
<li>Configurable hot key screen switching
<li>Configurable hot key to lock to a screen
<li>Configurable hot key to pop up a screen switch menu
<li>Configure screen saver synchronization on or off
<li>Graphical interface configuration and control on all platforms
<li>Graphical status feedback on all platforms
<li>More supported clipboard formats (particularly rich text)
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Long term</h4>
<p>
Two features stand out as long term goals:
<ul>
<li>Support <span class="arg">N</span> computers on
<span class="arg">M</span> monitors
<li>Drag and drop across computers
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The first feature means sharing a monitor or monitors the way the
keyboard and mouse are shared.  With this, Synergy would be a full
KVM solution.  Not only would it support a few computers sharing
one screen (still using the mouse to roll from one screen to
another), but it should also support dozens of computers to provide
a solution for server farm administrators.  In this capacity, it
may need to support text (as opposed to bitmap graphics) screens.
</p>
<p>
The second feature would enhance the unified desktop illusion.  It
would make it possible to drag a file and possibly other objects
to another screen.  The object would be copied (or moved).  I expect
this to be a very tricky feature.
