<h4>Solutions</h4>
<ol>
<li><a name="problem1"></a><span class="fakelink">Cannot read configuration</span>
<p>
There's an error in the configuration file.  This error is always
accompanied by another message describing the problem.  Use that
message and the <a href="configuration.html">configuration documentation</a>
to determine the fix.
</p>
<li><a name="problem2"></a><span class="fakelink">Connection forcefully rejected</span>
<p>
The client was able to contact the server computer but the server was
not listening for clients.  Possible reasons are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The client is using the wrong server
<p>
Make sure the client is using the hostname or IP address of the computer
running the synergy server.
</p>
<li>Synergy isn't running on the server
<p>
Make sure the synergy server is running on the server computer.  Make
sure the server is ready to accept connections.  If another program is
using synergy's port (24800 by default) then synergy can't start unless
you specify a different port.
</p>
<li>The client is using the wrong port
<p>
Synergy uses port 24800 by default but you can specify a different port.
If you do use a different port you must use that port on the server and
all clients.
</p>
</ul>
<li><a name="problem3"></a><span class="fakelink">Connection timed out</span>
<p>
The most likely reasons for this are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A firewall
<p>
A firewall is a program or device that deliberately blocks network
connections for security reasons.  Typically, they'll silently drop
packets they don't want rather than sending a rejection to the sender.
This makes it more difficult for intruders to break in.
</p><p>
When synergy traffic hits a firewall and gets dropped, eventually the
synergy client will give up waiting for a response and time out.  To
allow synergy traffic through first find all the firewalls on the
network between and on the synergy client and server computers.
</p><p>
A firewall on the server or any network device between the server and
any client should allow packets to TCP port 24800.  (Port 24800 is the
default;  use whichever port you've selected.)  You'll have to consult
the manual for your operating system, device, or firewall software to
find out how to do this.
</p><p>
Usually you'll won't need to adjust a firewall on client machines.
That's because firewalls normally allow incoming traffic on any port
they've initiated a connection on.  The reasoning is, of course, if
you started a conversation you probably want to hear the reply.
</p>
<li>The network is down or busy
<p>
Correct the network problem and try again.  You might try
<span class="code">ping</span> to see if the two computers can see
each other on the network.
</p>
<li>The server is frozen
<p>
If the synergy server is running but locked up or very busy then the
client may get this message.  If the server is locked up then you'll
probably have to restart it.  If it's just very busy then the client
should successfully connect automatically once the server settles down.
</p>
</ul>
<li><a name="problem4"></a><span class="fakelink">Cannot listen for clients</span>
<p>
Synergy tried to start listening for clients but the network port is
unavailable for some reason.  Typical reasons are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>No network devices
<p>
You must have a TCP/IP network device installed and enabled to use
synergy.
</p>
<li>A synergy server is already running
<p>
Check that a synergy server isn't already running.
</p>
<li>Another program is using synergy's port
<p>
Only one program at a time can listen for connections on a given port.
If the specific error is that the address is already in use and you've
ruled out the other causes, then it's likely another program is already
using synergy's port.  By default synergy uses port 24800.  Try having
synergy use a different port number, like 24801 or 24900.  Note that
the server and all clients must use the same port number.  Alternatively,
find the other program and stop it or have it use another port.
</p>
</ul>
<li><a name="problem5"></a><span class="fakelink">Unknown screen name "XXX"</span>
<p>
This error can be reported when reading the configuration;  see
<a href="#problem1">cannot read configuration</a>.  If the configuration
was read successfully and you get this error then it means that the
server's screen is not in the configuration.  All screens must be listed
in the configuration.
</p><p>
A common reason for this is when you haven't used the system's hostname
as its screen name.  By default, synergy uses the hostname as the screen
name.  If you used a different screen name in the configuration then you
must tell synergy what that name is.  Let's say the hostname is
<span class="code">frederick</span> but the configuration defines a screen
named <span class="code">fred</span>.  Then you must tell the server
that its screen name is <span class="code">fred</span> by using the
<span class="code">--name fred</span> command line option or setting
the screen name in the advanced options dialog to
<span class="code">fred</span>.
</p><p>
Alternatively, you can specify one name as an alias of another.  See
the <a href="configuration.html#aliases">configuration documentation</a>
for details.
</p><p>
Another common reason for this is a mismatch between what you think the
hostname is and what synergy thinks it is.  Typically this is a problem
with fully qualified domain names (FQDN).  Perhaps you think your system
is named <span class="code">fred</span> but synergy thinks it's
<span class="code">fred.nowhere.com</span> or
<span class="code">fred.local</span>.  You can use either solution above
to fix this.
</p>
<li><a name="problem6"></a><span class="fakelink">Server refused client with name "XXX"</span>
<br><span class="fakelink">A client with name "XXX" is not in the map</span>
<p>
The client is using a screen name not in the server's configuration.
This is essentially the same problem as <a href="#problem5">Unknown
screen name "XXX"</a> and has the same solutions:  specify another
screen name or add an alias.
</p>
<li><a name="problem7"></a><span class="fakelink">Server already has a connected client with name "XXX"</span>
<br><span class="fakelink">A client with name "XXX" is already connected</span>
<p>
This happens when:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Two clients try use the same screen name
<p>
Each client must have a unique screen name.  Configure at least one
client to use a different screen name.
</p>
<li>One client reconnects without cleanly disconnecting
<p>
It's possible for a client to disconnect without the server knowing,
usually by being disconnected from the network or possibly by going
to sleep or even crashing.  The server is left thinking the client is
still connected so when the client reconnects the server will think
this is a different client using the same name.  Synergy will usually
detect and correct this problem within a few seconds.  If it doesn't
then restart the server.
</p>
</ul>
<li><a name="problem8"></a><span class="fakelink">Server has incompatible version</span>
<p>
You're using different versions of synergy on the client and server.
You should use the same version on all systems.
</p>
<li><a name="problem9"></a><span class="fakelink">The cursor goes to secondary screen but won't come back</span>
