QSynergy for Unix build instructions
====================================


Requirements:
-------------
Qt 4.3 or newer. QSynergy can not be built or used with earlier versions. Get
it from http://trolltech.com/downloads/opensource

If you install from your distributions's package repository, don't forget to
install the development packages as well. 


Compilation:
------------
1. Unpack the sources to a directory.

2. Run qmake for your Qt4 installtion in that directory (make sure you do not
accidentally run the Qt3-qmake if your Linux distribution installs both, like
Ubuntu seems to do). See the qmake documentation for available command line
options. You might want to enable a release build by passing CONFIG="-debug
+release" to qmake.

3. qmake will have generated a Makefile now, so just run make in that directory
and wait for the build to finish.


Installation:
-------------
There is no installation required. Just copy the qsynergy binary to somewhere
in your path. The binary does not depend on any other files.


Building a Debian package
-------------------------
The source tarball comes with a fully configured debian subdir, so it's easy to
build a Debian package. A script is available in the dist subdir, deb.sh, that
will do this automatically. Just run this script. If you have all the tools and
helper programs installed to build a Debian package, you should get a package
for your platform in tmp/debian. 

Please contact QSynergy's author to contribute your newly built package for
download on the QSynergy website: vl@fidra.de
