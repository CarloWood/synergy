// TODO: consider whether or not to use either encapsulation (as below)
// or inheritance (as it is now) for the ARCH stuff.
//
// case for encapsulation:
// pros:
//  - compiler errors for missing pv implementations are not absolutely bonkers.
//  - function names don't have to be so verbose.
//  - easier to understand and debug.
//  - ctors in IArch implementations can call other implementations.
// cons:
//  - slightly more code for calls to ARCH.
//  - you'll have to modify each ARCH call.
//
// also, we may want to consider making each encapsulated
// class lazy-loaded so that apps like the daemon don't load
// stuff when they don't need it.
