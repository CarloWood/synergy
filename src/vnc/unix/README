VNC Free Edition Source Distribution for Unix platforms
==============================================

Copyright (C) 2002-2005 RealVNC Ltd.  All Rights Reserved.

This software is distributed under the GNU General Public Licence as published
by the Free Software Foundation.  See the file LICENCE.TXT for the conditions
under which this software is made available.  VNC also contains code from other
sources.  See the Acknowledgements section below, and the individual files for
details of the conditions under which they are made available.


There are six programs here:

  vncviewer - this is the VNC viewer, or client, program for X.

  Xvnc - this is the X VNC server - it is both a VNC server and an X server
         with a "virtual" framebuffer.  You normally use the vncserver script
         to start Xvnc.

  vncserver - this is a wrapper script which makes starting an X VNC server
              (i.e. desktop) more convenient.  It is written in Perl, so to use
              the script you need that.

  vncpasswd - this program allows you to change the password used to access
              your X VNC desktops.  The vncserver script uses this program when
              you first start a VNC server.

  vncconfig - this program is used to configure and control a running instance
              of Xvnc.

  x0vncserver - this is an inefficient VNC server which continuously polls any
                X display, allowing it to be controlled via VNC.  It is
                intended mainly as a demonstration of a simple VNC server.

In addition to these standalone programs, this distribution can also be used to
turn the native X server for a platform into a VNC server.  For XFree86 version
4 servers, this is done using a module loaded at run-time.  For other X servers
it requires replacing the native X server binary.

To build this distribution you need a C++ compiler as well as a C compiler.
You also need a reasonably recent version of the X window system installed.
This comes as standard with most unix machines.  If you don't have it
installed, see http://www.xfree86.org or http://www.x.org

To build everything but Xvnc, do:

  % ./configure
  % make

This should build first some libraries - zlib, rdr, network, Xregion, rfb and
tx - then vncviewer, vncconfig and vncpasswd.  If you already have zlib
installed on your system you can run "./configure --with-installed-zlib" if you
prefer (this is strongly advised on FreeBSD, since we've been told there are
problems otherwise).

Building Xvnc
=============

Building Xvnc and the VNC support for native X servers is much more complex.
If you don't need to build it, skip to the section below on installing.

Xvnc differs from the other programs in that it is built inside the X source
tree.  Unlike previous versions of Xvnc, we do not provide an X source tree
with this distribution.  We have designed the distribution to be as independent
as possible of the X tree used.

We have successfully used XFree86 version 4.3.0 and 4.2.1 (available
from http://www.xfree86.org).  You could also try the new X.org tree
available from http://www.x.org.  Note that the X tree is enormous and
notoriously difficult to deal with - building it is not for the
faint-hearted!

Once you have a copy of the X source tree, make sure it is unpacked at the top
level of this distribution, so that the xc directory of the X source tree
matches the xc of this distribution, for example:

  % tar xzf X420src-1.tgz

In the case of XFree86 4.2.1, you will need only the contents of the first
two tarfiles, but you should also apply the 4.2.0->4.2.1 patches (available
from http://www.xfree86.org).
In the case of XFree86 4.3.0, you will need the contents of the first three
tarfiles.

Then you must apply a patch to some files in the X source tree:

  % patch -Np0 <xc.patch

If this works, you should be able to build the entire X tree, including Xvnc:

  % cd xc
  % make World

This will take a long time, and will quite probably fail for one reason or
another!  If you are having trouble, we suggest you try to build the X tree in
isolation first before attempting it with the VNC additions.

If successful, in the xc/programs/Xserver directory you should find an Xvnc
binary, plus the native X server binary(ies) for your platform with VNC support
compiled in.  If you are building from an XFree86 version 4 tree on a supported
platform, you should also find a vnc.so module in
xc/programs/Xserver/vnc/modules.

Exactly which X extensions and features are built into Xvnc and the native X
server binary is determined by the settings in xc/config/cf.  The file vnc.def
contains the settings we use to build our binary distributions.  You may need
to edit this and the other files as appropriate.

Installing
==========

Different unix platforms have different conventions for where software should
be installed.  To copy the programs to some directory which is in your PATH
environment variable, such as /usr/local/bin, there is a script called
vncinstall which you can use:

  % cd ..
  % ./vncinstall /usr/local/bin

This will also attempt to install the manual pages in an appropriate directory.
You can specify an alternative directory as a second argument to vncinstall:

  % ./vncinstall /usr/local/bin /usr/local/man

It will also try to install the vnc.so XFree86 version 4 module if appropriate.
This will be copied to the /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/extensions directory and can
be enabled like any other module by adding a Load "vnc" line to the Module
section of XF86Config.  The parameters listed in the Xvnc manual page can be
set as options in XF86Config e.g. Option "passwordFile" "/root/.vnc/passwd".
Note that for some reason options cannot be set in the Module section of
XF86Config - try the Screen section.

If you want to use the Java VNC viewer, you should copy the files from
the java directory to some suitable installation directory such as
/usr/local/vnc/classes:

  % mkdir -p /usr/local/vnc/classes
  % cp ../common/javabin/* /usr/local/vnc/classes

We recommend that you use the vncserver script to run Xvnc for you.  You can
edit the script as appropriate for your site.  Things you may need to change
include:

 * The location of Perl - if Perl is not installed in /usr/bin you'll need
   to edit the "#!/usr/bin/perl" first line of vncserver.

 * Xvnc's font path and color database.  If you have an installation of
   X which is not in the standard place you may need to add arguments to the
   Xvnc command line to set these.  These should be appended to the $cmd
   variable at the comment "# Add font path and color database...".

 * $vncJavaFiles - this specifies the location of the files for
   the VNC viewer Java applet.  The default is /usr/local/vnc/classes.
