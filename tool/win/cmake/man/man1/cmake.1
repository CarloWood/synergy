.PP
.nf
  cmake [options] <path\-to\-source>
  cmake [options] <path\-to\-existing\-build>
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The "cmake" executable is the CMake command\-line interface.  It may be used to configure projects in scripts.  Project configuration settings may be specified on the command line with the \-D option.  The \-i option will cause cmake to interactively prompt for such settings.

.PP
CMake is a cross\-platform build system generator.  Projects specify their build process with platform\-independent CMake listfiles included in each directory of a source tree with the name CMakeLists.txt. Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a native tool on their platform.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -C <initial-cache>
Pre\-load a script to populate the cache.

When cmake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with customizable settings for the project.  This option may be used to specify a file from which to load cache entries before the first pass through the project's cmake listfiles.  The loaded entries take priority over the project's default values.  The given file should be a CMake script containing SET commands that use the CACHE option, not a cache\-format file.

.TP
.B -D <var>:<type>=<value>
Create a cmake cache entry.

When cmake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a CMakeCache.txt file and populates it with customizable settings for the project.  This option may be used to specify a setting that takes priority over the project's default value.  The option may be repeated for as many cache entries as desired.

.TP
.B -U <globbing_expr>
Remove matching entries from CMake cache.

This option may be used to remove one or more variables from the CMakeCache.txt file, globbing expressions using * and ? are supported. The option may be repeated for as many cache entries as desired.


Use with care, you can make your CMakeCache.txt non\-working.

.TP
.B -G <generator-name>
Specify a makefile generator.

CMake may support multiple native build systems on certain platforms.  A makefile generator is responsible for generating a particular build system.  Possible generator names are specified in the Generators section.

.TP
.B -Wno-dev
Suppress developer warnings.

Suppress warnings that are meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files.

.TP
.B -Wdev
Enable developer warnings.

Enable warnings that are meant for the author of the CMakeLists.txt files.

.TP
.B -E
CMake command mode.

For true platform independence, CMake provides a list of commands that can be used on all systems. Run with \-E help for the usage information. Commands available are: chdir, copy, copy_if_different copy_directory, compare_files, echo, echo_append, environment, make_directory, md5sum, remove_directory, remove, tar, time, touch, touch_nocreate, write_regv, delete_regv, comspec, create_symlink.

.TP
.B -i
Run in wizard mode.

Wizard mode runs cmake interactively without a GUI.  The user is prompted to answer questions about the project configuration.  The answers are used to set cmake cache values.

.TP
.B -L[A][H]
List non\-advanced cached variables.

List cache variables will run CMake and list all the variables from the CMake cache that are not marked as INTERNAL or ADVANCED. This will effectively display current CMake settings, which can be then changed with \-D option. Changing some of the variable may result in more variables being created. If A is specified, then it will display also advanced variables. If H is specified, it will also display help for each variable.

.TP
.B --build <dir>
Build a CMake\-generated project binary tree.

This abstracts a native build tool's command\-line interface with the following options:


.nf
  <dir>          = Project binary directory to be built.
  \-\-target <tgt> = Build <tgt> instead of default targets.
  \-\-config <cfg> = For multi\-configuration tools, choose <cfg>.
  \-\-clean\-first  = Build target 'clean' first, then build.
                   (To clean only, use \-\-target 'clean'.)
  \-\-             = Pass remaining options to the native tool.
.fi

Run cmake \-\-build with no options for quick help.

.TP
.B -N
View mode only.

Only load the cache. Do not actually run configure and generate steps.

.TP
.B -P <file>
Process script mode.

Process the given cmake file as a script written in the CMake language.  No configure or generate step is performed and the cache is not modified. If variables are defined using \-D, this must be done before the \-P argument.

.TP
.B --graphviz=[file]
Generate graphviz of dependencies.

Generate a graphviz input file that will contain all the library and executable dependencies in the project.

.TP
.B --system-information [file]
Dump information about this system.

Dump a wide range of information about the current system. If run from the top of a binary tree for a CMake project it will dump additional information such as the cache, log files etc.

.TP
.B --debug-trycompile
Do not delete the try compile directories..

Do not delete the files and directories created for try_compile calls. This is useful in debugging failed try_compiles. It may however change the results of the try\-compiles as old junk from a previous try\-compile may cause a different test to either pass or fail incorrectly.  This option is best used for one try\-compile at a time, and only when debugging.

.TP

.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B add_custom_command
Add a custom build rule to the generated build system.

There are two main signatures for add_custom_command The first signature is for adding a custom command to produce an output.


.nf
  add_custom_command(OUTPUT output1 [output2 ...]
                     COMMAND command1 [ARGS] [args1...]
                     [COMMAND command2 [ARGS] [args2...] ...]
                     [MAIN_DEPENDENCY depend]
                     [DEPENDS [depends...]]
                     [IMPLICIT_DEPENDS <lang1> depend1 ...]
                     [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                     [COMMENT comment] [VERBATIM] [APPEND])
.fi

This defines a command to generate specified OUTPUT file(s).  A target created in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt file) that specifies any output of the custom command as a source file is given a rule to generate the file using the command at build time.  If an output name is a relative path it will be interpreted relative to the build tree directory corresponding to the current source directory. Note that MAIN_DEPENDENCY is completely optional and is used as a suggestion to visual studio about where to hang the custom command. In makefile terms this creates a new target in the following form:


.nf
  OUTPUT: MAIN_DEPENDENCY DEPENDS
          COMMAND
.fi

If more than one command is specified they will be executed in order. The optional ARGS argument is for backward compatibility and will be ignored.


The second signature adds a custom command to a target such as a library or executable. This is useful for performing an operation before or after building the target. The command becomes part of the target and will only execute when the target itself is built.  If the target is already built, the command will not execute.


.nf
  add_custom_command(TARGET target
                     PRE_BUILD | PRE_LINK | POST_BUILD
                     COMMAND command1 [ARGS] [args1...]
                     [COMMAND command2 [ARGS] [args2...] ...]
                     [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                     [COMMENT comment] [VERBATIM])
.fi

This defines a new command that will be associated with building the specified target. When the command will happen is determined by which of the following is specified:


.nf
  PRE_BUILD \- run before all other dependencies
  PRE_LINK \- run after other dependencies
  POST_BUILD \- run after the target has been built
.fi

Note that the PRE_BUILD option is only supported on Visual Studio 7 or later. For all other generators PRE_BUILD will be treated as PRE_LINK.


If WORKING_DIRECTORY is specified the command will be executed in the directory given. If COMMENT is set, the value will be displayed as a message before the commands are executed at build time. If APPEND is specified the COMMAND and DEPENDS option values are appended to the custom command for the first output specified. There must have already been a previous call to this command with the same output. The COMMENT, WORKING_DIRECTORY, and MAIN_DEPENDENCY options are currently ignored when APPEND is given, but may be used in the future.


If VERBATIM is given then all arguments to the commands will be escaped properly for the build tool so that the invoked command receives each argument unchanged.  Note that one level of escapes is still used by the CMake language processor before add_custom_command even sees the arguments. Use of VERBATIM is recommended as it enables correct behavior. When VERBATIM is not given the behavior is platform specific because there is no protection of tool\-specific special characters.


If the output of the custom command is not actually created as a file on disk it should be marked as SYMBOLIC with SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES.


The IMPLICIT_DEPENDS option requests scanning of implicit dependencies of an input file.  The language given specifies the programming language whose corresponding dependency scanner should be used.  Currently only C and CXX language scanners are supported. Dependencies discovered from the scanning are added to those of the custom command at build time.  Note that the IMPLICIT_DEPENDS option is currently supported only for Makefile generators and will be ignored by other generators.


If COMMAND specifies an executable target (created by ADD_EXECUTABLE) it will automatically be replaced by the location of the executable created at build time.  Additionally a target\-level dependency will be added so that the executable target will be built before any target using this custom command.  However this does NOT add a file\-level dependency that would cause the custom command to re\-run whenever the executable is recompiled.


The DEPENDS option specifies files on which the command depends.  If any dependency is an OUTPUT of another custom command in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt file) CMake automatically brings the other custom command into the target in which this command is built.  If DEPENDS specifies any target (created by an ADD_* command) a target\-level dependency is created to make sure the target is built before any target using this custom command.  Additionally, if the target is an executable or library a file\-level dependency is created to cause the custom command to re\-run whenever the target is recompiled.


.TP
.B add_custom_target
Add a target with no output so it will always be built.

.nf
  add_custom_target(Name [ALL] [command1 [args1...]]
                    [COMMAND command2 [args2...] ...]
                    [DEPENDS depend depend depend ... ]
                    [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                    [COMMENT comment] [VERBATIM]
                    [SOURCES src1 [src2...]])
.fi

Adds a target with the given name that executes the given commands. The target has no output file and is ALWAYS CONSIDERED OUT OF DATE even if the commands try to create a file with the name of the target. Use ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND to generate a file with dependencies. By default nothing depends on the custom target. Use ADD_DEPENDENCIES to add dependencies to or from other targets. If the ALL option is specified it indicates that this target should be added to the default build target so that it will be run every time (the command cannot be called ALL). The command and arguments are optional and if not specified an empty target will be created. If WORKING_DIRECTORY is set, then the command will be run in that directory. If COMMENT is set, the value will be displayed as a message before the commands are executed at build time. Dependencies listed with the DEPENDS argument may reference files and outputs of custom commands created with add_custom_command() in the same directory (CMakeLists.txt file).


If VERBATIM is given then all arguments to the commands will be escaped properly for the build tool so that the invoked command receives each argument unchanged.  Note that one level of escapes is still used by the CMake language processor before add_custom_target even sees the arguments. Use of VERBATIM is recommended as it enables correct behavior. When VERBATIM is not given the behavior is platform specific because there is no protection of tool\-specific special characters.


The SOURCES option specifies additional source files to be included in the custom target.  Specified source files will be added to IDE project files for convenience in editing even if they have not build rules.

.TP
.B add_definitions
Adds \-D define flags to the compilation of source files.

.nf
  add_definitions(\-DFOO \-DBAR ...)
.fi

Adds flags to the compiler command line for sources in the current directory and below.  This command can be used to add any flags, but it was originally intended to add preprocessor definitions.  Flags beginning in \-D or /D that look like preprocessor definitions are automatically added to the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property for the current directory.  Definitions with non\-trival values may be left in the set of flags instead of being converted for reasons of backwards compatibility.  See documentation of the directory, target, and source file COMPILE_DEFINITIONS properties for details on adding preprocessor definitions to specific scopes and configurations.

.TP
.B add_dependencies
Add a dependency between top\-level targets.

.nf
  add_dependencies(target\-name depend\-target1
                   depend\-target2 ...)
.fi

Make a top\-level target depend on other top\-level targets.  A top\-level target is one created by ADD_EXECUTABLE, ADD_LIBRARY, or ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET.  Adding dependencies with this command can be used to make sure one target is built before another target.  See the DEPENDS option of ADD_CUSTOM_TARGET and ADD_CUSTOM_COMMAND for adding file\-level dependencies in custom rules.  See the OBJECT_DEPENDS option in SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES to add file\-level dependencies to object files.

.TP
.B add_executable
Add an executable to the project using the specified source files.

.nf
  add_executable(<name> [WIN32] [MACOSX_BUNDLE]
                 [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
                 source1 source2 ... sourceN)
.fi

Adds an executable target called <name> to be built from the source files listed in the command invocation.  The <name> corresponds to the logical target name and must be globally unique within a project.  The actual file name of the executable built is constructed based on conventions of the native platform (such as <name>.exe or just <name>).  


By default the executable file will be created in the build tree directory corresponding to the source tree directory in which the command was invoked.  See documentation of the RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY target property to change this location.  See documentation of the OUTPUT_NAME target property to change the <name> part of the final file name.  


If WIN32 is given the property WIN32_EXECUTABLE will be set on the target created.  See documentation of that target property for details.


If MACOSX_BUNDLE is given the corresponding property will be set on the created target.  See documentation of the MACOSX_BUNDLE target property for details.


If EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL is given the corresponding property will be set on the created target.  See documentation of the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL target property for details.


The add_executable command can also create IMPORTED executable targets using this signature:


.nf
  add_executable(<name> IMPORTED)
.fi

An IMPORTED executable target references an executable file located outside the project.  No rules are generated to build it.  The target name has scope in the directory in which it is created and below.  It may be referenced like any target built within the project.  IMPORTED executables are useful for convenient reference from commands like add_custom_command.  Details about the imported executable are specified by setting properties whose names begin in "IMPORTED_".  The most important such property is IMPORTED_LOCATION (and its per\-configuration version IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>) which specifies the location of the main executable file on disk.  See documentation of the IMPORTED_* properties for more information.

.TP
.B add_library
Add a library to the project using the specified source files.

.nf
  add_library(<name> [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE]
              [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
              source1 source2 ... sourceN)
.fi

Adds a library target called <name> to be built from the source files listed in the command invocation.  The <name> corresponds to the logical target name and must be globally unique within a project.  The actual file name of the library built is constructed based on conventions of the native platform (such as lib<name>.a or <name>.lib).


STATIC, SHARED, or MODULE may be given to specify the type of library to be created.  STATIC libraries are archives of object files for use when linking other targets.  SHARED libraries are linked dynamically and loaded at runtime.  MODULE libraries are plugins that are not linked into other targets but may be loaded dynamically at runtime using dlopen\-like functionality.  If no type is given explicitly the type is STATIC or SHARED based on whether the current value of the variable BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is true.


By default the library file will be created in the build tree directory corresponding to the source tree directory in which the command was invoked.  See documentation of the ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, and RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY target properties to change this location.  See documentation of the OUTPUT_NAME target property to change the <name> part of the final file name.  


If EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL is given the corresponding property will be set on the created target.  See documentation of the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL target property for details.


The add_library command can also create IMPORTED library targets using this signature:


.nf
  add_library(<name> <SHARED|STATIC|MODULE|UNKNOWN> IMPORTED)
.fi

An IMPORTED library target references a library file located outside the project.  No rules are generated to build it.  The target name has scope in the directory in which it is created and below.  It may be referenced like any target built within the project.  IMPORTED libraries are useful for convenient reference from commands like target_link_libraries.  Details about the imported library are specified by setting properties whose names begin in "IMPORTED_".  The most important such property is IMPORTED_LOCATION (and its per\-configuration version IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>) which specifies the location of the main library file on disk.  See documentation of the IMPORTED_* properties for more information.

.TP
.B add_subdirectory
Add a subdirectory to the build.

.nf
  add_subdirectory(source_dir [binary_dir] 
                   [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL])
.fi

Add a subdirectory to the build. The source_dir specifies the directory in which the source CmakeLists.txt and code files are located. If it is a relative path it will be evaluated with respect to the current directory (the typical usage), but it may also be an absolute path. The binary_dir specifies the directory in which to place the output files. If it is a relative path it will be evaluated with respect to the current output directory, but it may also be an absolute path. If binary_dir is not specified, the value of source_dir, before expanding any relative path, will be used (the typical usage). The CMakeLists.txt file in the specified source directory will be processed immediately by CMake before processing in the current input file continues beyond this command.


If the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL argument is provided then targets in the subdirectory will not be included in the ALL target of the parent directory by default, and will be excluded from IDE project files.  Users must explicitly build targets in the subdirectory.  This is meant for use when the subdirectory contains a separate part of the project that is useful but not necessary, such as a set of examples.  Typically the subdirectory should contain its own project() command invocation so that a full build system will be generated in the subdirectory (such as a VS IDE solution file).  Note that inter\-target dependencies supercede this exclusion.  If a target built by the parent project depends on a target in the subdirectory, the dependee target will be included in the parent project build system to satisfy the dependency.

.TP
.B add_test
Add a test to the project with the specified arguments.

.nf
  add_test(testname Exename arg1 arg2 ...)
.fi

If the ENABLE_TESTING command has been run, this command adds a test target to the current directory. If ENABLE_TESTING has not been run, this command does nothing.  The tests are run by the testing subsystem by executing Exename with the specified arguments.  Exename can be either an executable built by this project or an arbitrary executable on the system (like tclsh).  The test will be run with the current working directory set to the CMakeList.txt files corresponding directory in the binary tree.


.nf
  add_test(NAME <name> [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
           COMMAND <command> [arg1 [arg2 ...]])
.fi

If COMMAND specifies an executable target (created by add_executable) it will automatically be replaced by the location of the executable created at build time.  If a CONFIGURATIONS option is given then the test will be executed only when testing under one of the named configurations.


Arguments after COMMAND may use "generator expressions" with the syntax "$<...>".  These expressions are evaluted during build system generation and produce information specific to each generated build configuration.  Valid expressions are:


.nf
  $<CONFIGURATION>          = configuration name
  $<TARGET_FILE:tgt>        = main file (.exe, .so.1.2, .a)
  $<TARGET_LINKER_FILE:tgt> = file used to link (.a, .lib, .so)
  $<TARGET_SONAME_FILE:tgt> = file with soname (.so.3)
.fi

where "tgt" is the name of a target.  Target file expressions produce a full path, but _DIR and _NAME versions can produce the directory and file name components:


.nf
  $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:tgt>/$<TARGET_FILE_NAME:tgt>
  $<TARGET_LINKER_FILE_DIR:tgt>/$<TARGET_LINKER_FILE_NAME:tgt>
  $<TARGET_SONAME_FILE_DIR:tgt>/$<TARGET_SONAME_FILE_NAME:tgt>
.fi

Example usage:


.nf
  add_test(NAME mytest
           COMMAND testDriver \-\-config $<CONFIGURATION>
                              \-\-exe $<TARGET_FILE:myexe>)
.fi

This creates a test "mytest" whose command runs a testDriver tool passing the configuration name and the full path to the executable file produced by target "myexe".

.TP
.B aux_source_directory
Find all source files in a directory.

.nf
  aux_source_directory(<dir> <variable>)
.fi

Collects the names of all the source files in the specified directory and stores the list in the <variable> provided.  This command is intended to be used by projects that use explicit template instantiation.  Template instantiation files can be stored in a "Templates" subdirectory and collected automatically using this command to avoid manually listing all instantiations.


It is tempting to use this command to avoid writing the list of source files for a library or executable target.  While this seems to work, there is no way for CMake to generate a build system that knows when a new source file has been added.  Normally the generated build system knows when it needs to rerun CMake because the CMakeLists.txt file is modified to add a new source.  When the source is just added to the directory without modifying this file, one would have to manually rerun CMake to generate a build system incorporating the new file.

.B build_command
Get the command line that will build this project.

.nf
  build_command(<variable> <makecommand>)
.fi

Sets the given <variable> to a string containing the command that will build this project from the root of the build tree using the build tool given by <makecommand>.  <makecommand> should be msdev, nmake, make or one of the end user build tools.  This is useful for configuring testing systems.

.TP
.B cmake_minimum_required
Set the minimum required version of cmake for a project.

.nf
  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION major[.minor[.patch]]
                         [FATAL_ERROR])
.fi

If the current version of CMake is lower than that required it will stop processing the project and report an error.  When a version higher than 2.4 is specified the command implicitly invokes


.nf
  cmake_policy(VERSION major[.minor[.patch]])
.fi

which sets the cmake policy version level to the version specified.  When version 2.4 or lower is given the command implicitly invokes


.nf
  cmake_policy(VERSION 2.4)
.fi

which enables compatibility features for CMake 2.4 and lower.


The FATAL_ERROR option is accepted but ignored by CMake 2.6 and higher.  It should be specified so CMake versions 2.4 and lower fail with an error instead of just a warning.

.TP
.B cmake_policy
Manage CMake Policy settings.

As CMake evolves it is sometimes necessary to change existing behavior in order to fix bugs or improve implementations of existing features.  The CMake Policy mechanism is designed to help keep existing projects building as new versions of CMake introduce changes in behavior.  Each new policy (behavioral change) is given an identifier of the form "CMP<NNNN>" where "<NNNN>" is an integer index.  Documentation associated with each policy describes the OLD and NEW behavior and the reason the policy was introduced.  Projects may set each policy to select the desired behavior.  When CMake needs to know which behavior to use it checks for a setting specified by the project.  If no setting is available the OLD behavior is assumed and a warning is produced requesting that the policy be set.


The cmake_policy command is used to set policies to OLD or NEW behavior.  While setting policies individually is supported, we encourage projects to set policies based on CMake versions.


.nf
  cmake_policy(VERSION major.minor[.patch])
.fi

Specify that the current CMake list file is written for the given version of CMake.  All policies introduced in the specified version or earlier will be set to use NEW behavior.  All policies introduced after the specified version will be unset.  This effectively requests behavior preferred as of a given CMake version and tells newer CMake versions to warn about their new policies.  The policy version specified must be at least 2.4 or the command will report an error.  In order to get compatibility features supporting versions earlier than 2.4 see documentation of policy CMP0001.


.nf
  cmake_policy(SET CMP<NNNN> NEW)
  cmake_policy(SET CMP<NNNN> OLD)
.fi

Tell CMake to use the OLD or NEW behavior for a given policy.  Projects depending on the old behavior of a given policy may silence a policy warning by setting the policy state to OLD.  Alternatively one may fix the project to work with the new behavior and set the policy state to NEW.


.nf
  cmake_policy(GET CMP<NNNN> <variable>)
.fi

Check whether a given policy is set to OLD or NEW behavior.  The output variable value will be "OLD" or "NEW" if the policy is set, and empty otherwise.


CMake keeps policy settings on a stack, so changes made by the cmake_policy command affect only the top of the stack.  A new entry on the policy stack is managed automatically for each subdirectory to protect its parents and siblings.  CMake also manages a new entry for scripts loaded by include() and find_package() commands except when invoked with the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option (see also policy CMP0011).  The cmake_policy command provides an interface to manage custom entries on the policy stack:


.nf
  cmake_policy(PUSH)
  cmake_policy(POP)
.fi

Each PUSH must have a matching POP to erase any changes.  This is useful to make temporary changes to policy settings.


Functions and macros record policy settings when they are created and use the pre\-record policies when they are invoked.  If the function or macro implementation sets policies, the changes automatically propagate up through callers until they reach the closest nested policy stack entry.

.TP
.B configure_file
Copy a file to another location and modify its contents.

.nf
  configure_file(<input> <output>
                 [COPYONLY] [ESCAPE_QUOTES] [@ONLY])
.fi

Copies a file <input> to file <output> and substitutes variable values referenced in the file content.  If <input> is a relative path it is evaluated with respect to the current source directory.  The <input> must be a file, not a directory.  If <output> is a relative path it is evaluated with respect to the current binary directory.  If <output> names an existing directory the input file is placed in that directory with its original name.  


This command replaces any variables in the input file referenced as ${VAR} or @VAR@ with their values as determined by CMake.  If a variable is not defined, it will be replaced with nothing.  If COPYONLY is specified, then no variable expansion will take place.  If ESCAPE_QUOTES is specified then any substituted quotes will be C\-style escaped.  The file will be configured with the current values of CMake variables. If @ONLY is specified, only variables of the form @VAR@ will be replaces and ${VAR} will be ignored.  This is useful for configuring scripts that use ${VAR}. Any occurrences of #cmakedefine VAR will be replaced with either #define VAR or /* #undef VAR */ depending on the setting of VAR in CMake. Any occurrences of #cmakedefine01 VAR will be replaced with either #define VAR 1 or #define VAR 0 depending on whether VAR evaluates to TRUE or FALSE in CMake

.TP
.B create_test_sourcelist
Create a test driver and source list for building test programs.

.nf
  create_test_sourcelist(sourceListName driverName
                         test1 test2 test3
                         EXTRA_INCLUDE include.h
                         FUNCTION function)
.fi

A test driver is a program that links together many small tests into a single executable.  This is useful when building static executables with large libraries to shrink the total required size.  The list of source files needed to build the test driver will be in sourceListName.  DriverName is the name of the test driver program.  The rest of the arguments consist of a list of test source files, can be semicolon separated.  Each test source file should have a function in it that is the same name as the file with no extension (foo.cxx should have int foo(int, char*[]);) DriverName will be able to call each of the tests by name on the command line. If EXTRA_INCLUDE is specified, then the next argument is included into the generated file. If FUNCTION is specified, then the next argument is taken as a function name that is passed a pointer to ac and av.  This can be used to add extra command line processing to each test. The cmake variable CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_BEFORE_TESTMAIN can be set to have code that will be placed directly before calling the test main function.   CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_AFTER_TESTMAIN can be set to have code that will be placed directly after the call to the test main function.

.TP
.B define_property
Define and document custom properties.

.nf
  define_property(<GLOBAL | DIRECTORY | TARGET | SOURCE |

                   PROPERTY <name> [INHERITED]
                   BRIEF_DOCS <brief\-doc> [docs...]
                   FULL_DOCS <full\-doc> [docs...])
.fi

Define one property in a scope for use with the set_property and get_property commands.  This is primarily useful to associate documentation with property names that may be retrieved with the get_property command.  The first argument determines the kind of scope in which the property should be used.  It must be one of the following:


.nf
  GLOBAL    = associated with the global namespace
  DIRECTORY = associated with one directory
  TARGET    = associated with one target
  SOURCE    = associated with one source file
  TEST      = associated with a test named with add_test
  VARIABLE  = documents a CMake language variable
  CACHED_VARIABLE = documents a CMake cache variable
.fi

Note that unlike set_property and get_property no actual scope needs to be given; only the kind of scope is important.


The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by the name of the property being defined.


If the INHERITED option then the get_property command will chain up to the next higher scope when the requested property is not set in the scope given to the command.  DIRECTORY scope chains to GLOBAL.  TARGET, SOURCE, and TEST chain to DIRECTORY.


The BRIEF_DOCS and FULL_DOCS options are followed by strings to be associated with the property as its brief and full documentation.  Corresponding options to the get_property command will retrieve the documentation.

.fi

Runs the given sequence of one or more commands with the standard output of each process piped to the standard input of the next.  A single standard error pipe is used for all processes.  If WORKING_DIRECTORY is given the named directory will be set as the current working directory of the child processes.  If TIMEOUT is given the child processes will be terminated if they do not finish in the specified number of seconds (fractions are allowed).  If RESULT_VARIABLE is given the variable will be set to contain the result of running the processes.  This will be an integer return code from the last child or a string describing an error condition.  If OUTPUT_VARIABLE or ERROR_VARIABLE are given the variable named will be set with the contents of the standard output and standard error pipes respectively.  If the same variable is named for both pipes their output will be merged in the order produced.  If INPUT_FILE, OUTPUT_FILE, or ERROR_FILE is given the file named will be attached to the standard input of the first process, standard output of the last process, or standard error of all processes respectively.  If OUTPUT_QUIET or ERROR_QUIET is given then the standard output or standard error results will be quietly ignored.  If more than one OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* option is given for the same pipe the precedence is not specified.  If no OUTPUT_* or ERROR_* options are given the output will be shared with the corresponding pipes of the CMake process itself.


The execute_process command is a newer more powerful version of exec_program, but the old command has been kept for compatibility.

.TP
.B export
Export targets from the build tree for use by outside projects.

.nf
  export(TARGETS [target1 [target2 [...]]] [NAMESPACE <namespace>]
         [APPEND] FILE <filename>)
.fi

Create a file <filename> that may be included by outside projects to import targets from the current project's build tree.  This is useful during cross\-compiling to build utility executables that can run on the host platform in one project and then import them into another project being compiled for the target platform.  If the NAMESPACE option is given the <namespace> string will be prepended to all target names written to the file.  If the APPEND option is given the generated code will be appended to the file instead of overwriting it.  If a library target is included in the export but a target to which it links is not included the behavior is unspecified.


The file created by this command is specific to the build tree and should never be installed.  See the install(EXPORT) command to export targets from an installation tree.


.nf
  export(PACKAGE <name>)
.fi

Store the current build directory in the CMake user package registry for package <name>.  The find_package command may consider the directory while searching for package <name>.  This helps dependent projects find and use a package from the current project's build tree without help from the user.  Note that the entry in the package registry that this command creates works only in conjunction with a package configuration file (<name>Config.cmake) that works with the build tree.

  file(TO_CMAKE_PATH path result)
  file(TO_NATIVE_PATH path result)
  file(DOWNLOAD url file [TIMEOUT timeout] [STATUS status] [LOG log])
.fi

WRITE will write a message into a file called 'filename'. It overwrites the file if it already exists, and creates the file if it does not exist.


APPEND will write a message into a file same as WRITE, except it will append it to the end of the file


READ will read the content of a file and store it into the variable. It will start at the given offset and read up to numBytes. If the argument HEX is given, the binary data will be converted to hexadecimal representation and this will be stored in the variable.


STRINGS will parse a list of ASCII strings from a file and store it in a variable. Binary data in the file are ignored. Carriage return (CR) characters are ignored. It works also for Intel Hex and Motorola S\-record files, which are automatically converted to binary format when reading them. Disable this using NO_HEX_CONVERSION.


LIMIT_COUNT sets the maximum number of strings to return. LIMIT_INPUT sets the maximum number of bytes to read from the input file. LIMIT_OUTPUT sets the maximum number of bytes to store in the output variable. LENGTH_MINIMUM sets the minimum length of a string to return. Shorter strings are ignored. LENGTH_MAXIMUM sets the maximum length of a string to return.  Longer strings are split into strings no longer than the maximum length. NEWLINE_CONSUME allows newlines to be included in strings instead of terminating them.


REGEX specifies a regular expression that a string must match to be returned. Typical usage 


.nf
  file(STRINGS myfile.txt myfile)
.fi

stores a list in the variable "myfile" in which each item is a line from the input file.


GLOB will generate a list of all files that match the globbing expressions and store it into the variable. Globbing expressions are similar to regular expressions, but much simpler. If RELATIVE flag is specified for an expression, the results will be returned as a relative path to the given path.


Examples of globbing expressions include:


.nf
   *.cxx      \- match all files with extension cxx
   *.vt?      \- match all files with extension vta,...,vtz
   f[3\-5].txt \- match files f3.txt, f4.txt, f5.txt
.fi

GLOB_RECURSE will generate a list similar to the regular GLOB, except it will traverse all the subdirectories of the matched directory and match the files. Subdirectories that are symlinks are only traversed if FOLLOW_SYMLINKS is given or cmake policy CMP0009 is not set to NEW. See cmake \-\-help\-policy CMP0009 for more information.


Examples of recursive globbing include:


.nf
   /dir/*.py  \- match all python files in /dir and subdirectories
.fi

MAKE_DIRECTORY will create the given directories, also if their parent directories don't exist yet


RENAME moves a file or directory within a filesystem, replacing the destination atomically.


REMOVE will remove the given files, also in subdirectories


REMOVE_RECURSE will remove the given files and directories, also non\-empty directories


RELATIVE_PATH will determine relative path from directory to the given file.


TO_CMAKE_PATH will convert path into a cmake style path with unix /.  The input can be a single path or a system path like "$ENV{PATH}".  Note the double quotes around the ENV call TO_CMAKE_PATH only takes  one argument.


TO_NATIVE_PATH works just like TO_CMAKE_PATH, but will convert from  a cmake style path into the native path style \\ for windows and / for UNIX.


DOWNLOAD will download the given URL to the given file. If LOG var is specified a log of the download will be put in var. If STATUS var is specified the status of the operation will be put in var. The status is returned in a list of length 2. The first element is the numeric return value for the operation, and the second element is a string value for the error. A 0 numeric error means no error in the operation. If TIMEOUT time is specified, the operation will timeout after time seconds, time should be specified as an integer.


The file() command also provides COPY and INSTALL signatures:


.nf
  file(<COPY|INSTALL> files... DESTINATION <dir>
       [FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
       [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
       [NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS]
       [FILES_MATCHING]
       [[PATTERN <pattern> | REGEX <regex>]
        [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]] [...])
.fi

The COPY signature copies files, directories, and symlinks to a destination folder.  Relative input paths are evaluated with respect to the current source directory, and a relative destination is evaluated with respect to the current build directory.  Copying preserves input file timestamps, and optimizes out a file if it exists at the destination with the same timestamp.  Copying preserves input permissions unless explicit permissions or NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS are given (default is USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS).  See the install(DIRECTORY) command for documentation of permissions, PATTERN, REGEX, and EXCLUDE options.  


The INSTALL signature differs slightly from COPY: it prints status messages, and NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS is default.  Installation scripts generated by the install() command use this signature (with some undocumented options for internal use).

This command is used to find a full path to named file. A cache entry named by <VAR> is created to store the result of this command.  If the full path to a file is found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If nothing is found, the result will be <VAR>\-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again the next time find_file is invoked with the same variable.  The name of the full path to a file that is searched for is specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.   Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment variable var will be read and converted from a system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths.  For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the documentation string in the cache.  PATH_SUFFIXES specifies additional subdirectories to check below each search path.


If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the search process is as follows:


1. Search paths specified in cmake\-specific cache variables.  These are intended to be used on the command line with a \-DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.


.nf
   <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
   CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
   CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
.fi

2. Search paths specified in cmake\-specific environment variables.  These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.


.nf
   <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
   CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
   CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
.fi

3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option.  These should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided by the location of another item already found.  Hard\-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS option.


4. Search the standard system environment variables. This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.


.nf
   PATH
   INCLUDE

5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files for the current system.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.


.nf
   <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
   CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
   CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH
.fi

6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in the short\-hand version of the command.  These are typically hard\-coded guesses.


On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake variable    CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or one of the following:


.nf
   "FIRST"  \- Try to find frameworks before standard
              libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
   "LAST"   \- Try to find frameworks after standard

   "ONLY"   \- Only try to find frameworks.
   "NEVER" \- Never try to find frameworks.
.fi

On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of the following:


.nf
   "FIRST"  \- Try to find application bundles before standard
              programs. This is the default on Darwin.
   "LAST"   \- Try to find application bundles after standard
              programs.
   "ONLY"   \- Only try to find application bundles.
   "NEVER" \- Never try to find application bundles.
.fi

The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more directories to be prepended to all other search directories. This effectively "re\-roots" the entire search under given locations. By default it is empty. It is especially useful when cross\-compiling to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will search there too. By default at first the directories listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non\-rooted directories will be searched. The default behavior can be adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE.  This behavior can be manually overridden on a per\-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re\-rooted directories will be searched.


The default search order is designed to be most\-specific to least\-specific for common use cases.  Projects may override the order by simply calling the command multiple times and using the NO_* options:


.nf
   find_file(<VAR> NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
   find_file(<VAR> NAMES name)
.fi

Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search again.

Find a library.

.nf

This command is used to find a library. A cache entry named by <VAR> is created to store the result of this command.  If the library is found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If nothing is found, the result will be <VAR>\-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again the next time find_library is invoked with the same variable.  The name of the library that is searched for is specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.   Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment variable var will be read and converted from a system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths.  For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the documentation string in the cache.  PATH_SUFFIXES specifies additional subdirectories to check below each search path.


If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the search process is as follows:

Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search again.


If the library found is a framework, then VAR will be set to the full path to the framework <fullPath>/A.framework. When a full path to a framework is used as a library, CMake will use a \-framework A, and a \-F<fullPath> to link the framework to the target. 

.TP
.B find_package
Load settings for an external project.

.nf
  find_package(<package> [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]
               [[REQUIRED|COMPONENTS] [components...]]
               [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])
.fi

Finds and loads settings from an external project.  <package>_FOUND will be set to indicate whether the package was found.  When the package is found package\-specific information is provided through variables documented by the package itself.  The QUIET option disables messages if the package cannot be found.  The REQUIRED option stops processing with an error message if the package cannot be found.  A package\-specific list of components may be listed after the REQUIRED option or after the COMPONENTS option if no REQUIRED option is given.  The [version] argument requests a version with which the package found should be compatible (format is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).  The EXACT option requests that the version be matched exactly.  If no [version] is given to a recursive invocation inside a find\-module, the [version] and EXACT arguments are forwarded automatically from the outer call.  Version support is currently provided only on a package\-by\-package basis (details below).


User code should generally look for packages using the above simple signature.  The remainder of this command documentation specifies the full command signature and details of the search process.  Project maintainers wishing to provide a package to be found by this command are encouraged to read on.


The command has two modes by which it searches for packages: "Module" mode and "Config" mode.  Module mode is available when the command is invoked with the above reduced signature.  CMake searches for a file called "Find<package>.cmake" in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH followed by the CMake installation.  If the file is found, it is read and processed by CMake.  It is responsible for finding the package, checking the version, and producing any needed messages.  Many find\-modules provide limited or no support for versioning; check the module documentation.  If no module is found the command proceeds to Config mode.


The complete Config mode command signature is:


.nf
  find_package(<package> [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]
               [[REQUIRED|COMPONENTS] [components...]] [NO_MODULE]
               [NO_POLICY_SCOPE]
               [NAMES name1 [name2 ...]]
               [CONFIGS config1 [config2 ...]]
               [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ]]
               [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ]]
               [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
               [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
               [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
               [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
               [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
               [NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY]
               [NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH]
               [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
               [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
                ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
                NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH])
.fi

The NO_MODULE option may be used to skip Module mode explicitly.  It is also implied by use of options not specified in the reduced signature.  


Config mode attempts to locate a configuration file provided by the package to be found.  A cache entry called <package>_DIR is created to hold the directory containing the file.  By default the command searches for a package with the name <package>.  If the NAMES option is given the names following it are used instead of <package>.  The command searches for a file called "<name>Config.cmake" or "<lower\-case\-name>\-config.cmake" for each name specified.  A replacement set of possible configuration file names may be given using the CONFIGS option.  The search procedure is specified below.  Once found, the configuration file is read and processed by CMake.  Since the file is provided by the package it already knows the location of package contents.  The full path to the configuration file is stored in the cmake variable <package>_CONFIG.


If the package configuration file cannot be found CMake will generate an error describing the problem unless the QUIET argument is specified.  If REQUIRED is specified and the package is not found a fatal error is generated and the configure step stops executing.  If <package>_DIR has been set to a directory not containing a configuration file CMake will ignore it and search from scratch.


When the [version] argument is given Config mode will only find a version of the package that claims compatibility with the requested version (format is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).  If the EXACT option is given only a version of the package claiming an exact match of the requested version may be found.  CMake does not establish any convention for the meaning of version numbers.  Package version numbers are checked by "version" files provided by the packages themselves.  For a candidate package configuration file "<config\-file>.cmake" the corresponding version file is located next to it and named either "<config\-file>\-version.cmake" or "<config\-file>Version.cmake".  If no such version file is available then the configuration file is assumed to not be compatible with any requested version.  When a version file is found it is loaded to check the requested version number.  The version file is loaded in a nested scope in which the following variables have been defined:


.nf
  PACKAGE_FIND_NAME          = the <package> name
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION       = full requested version string
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if requested, else 0
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if requested, else 0
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if requested, else 0
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if requested, else 0
  PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4
.fi

The version file checks whether it satisfies the requested version and sets these variables:


.nf
  PACKAGE_VERSION            = full provided version string
  PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT      = true if version is exact match
  PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE = true if version is compatible
  PACKAGE_VERSION_UNSUITABLE = true if unsuitable as any version
.fi

These variables are checked by the find_package command to determine whether the configuration file provides an acceptable version.  They are not available after the find_package call returns.  If the version is acceptable the following variables are set:


.nf
  <package>_VERSION       = full provided version string
  <package>_VERSION_MAJOR = major version if provided, else 0
  <package>_VERSION_MINOR = minor version if provided, else 0
  <package>_VERSION_PATCH = patch version if provided, else 0
  <package>_VERSION_TWEAK = tweak version if provided, else 0
  <package>_VERSION_COUNT = number of version components, 0 to 4
.fi

and the corresponding package configuration file is loaded.  When multiple package configuration files are available whose version files claim compatibility with the version requested it is unspecified which one is chosen.  No attempt is made to choose a highest or closest version number.


Config mode provides an elaborate interface and search procedure.  Much of the interface is provided for completeness and for use internally by find\-modules loaded by Module mode.  Most user code should simply call


.nf
  find_package(<package> [major[.minor]] [EXACT] [REQUIRED|QUIET])
.fi

in order to find a package.  Package maintainers providing CMake package configuration files are encouraged to name and install them such that the procedure outlined below will find them without requiring use of additional options.


CMake constructs a set of possible installation prefixes for the package.  Under each prefix several directories are searched for a configuration file.  The tables below show the directories searched.  Each entry is meant for installation trees following Windows (W), UNIX (U), or Apple (A) conventions.


.nf
  <prefix>/                                               (W)
  <prefix>/(cmake|CMake)/                                 (W)
  <prefix>/<name>*/                                       (W)
  <prefix>/<name>*/(cmake|CMake)/                         (W)
  <prefix>/(share|lib)/cmake/<name>*/                     (U)
  <prefix>/(share|lib)/<name>*/                           (U)
  <prefix>/(share|lib)/<name>*/(cmake|CMake)/             (U)
.fi

On systems supporting OS X Frameworks and Application Bundles the following directories are searched for frameworks or bundles containing a configuration file:


.nf
  <prefix>/<name>.framework/Resources/                    (A)
  <prefix>/<name>.framework/Resources/CMake/              (A)
  <prefix>/<name>.framework/Versions/*/Resources/         (A)
  <prefix>/<name>.framework/Versions/*/Resources/CMake/   (A)
  <prefix>/<name>.app/Contents/Resources/                 (A)
  <prefix>/<name>.app/Contents/Resources/CMake/           (A)
.fi

In all cases the <name> is treated as case\-insensitive and corresponds to any of the names specified (<package> or names given by NAMES).  If PATH_SUFFIXES is specified the suffixes are appended to each (W) or (U) directory entry one\-by\-one.


This set of directories is intended to work in cooperation with projects that provide configuration files in their installation trees.  Directories above marked with (W) are intended for installations on Windows where the prefix may point at the top of an application's installation directory.  Those marked with (U) are intended for installations on UNIX platforms where the prefix is shared by multiple packages.  This is merely a convention, so all (W) and (U) directories are still searched on all platforms.  Directories marked with (A) are intended for installations on Apple platforms.  The cmake variables CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK and CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE determine the order of preference as specified below.


The set of installation prefixes is constructed using the following steps.  If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified all NO_* options are enabled.


1. Search paths specified in cmake\-specific cache variables.  These are intended to be used on the command line with a \-DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.


.nf
   CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
   CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
   CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH
.fi

2. Search paths specified in cmake\-specific environment variables.  These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.


.nf
   CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
   CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
   CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH
.fi

3. Search paths specified by the HINTS option.  These should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided by the location of another item already found.  Hard\-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS option.


4. Search the standard system environment variables. This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.  Path entries ending in "/bin" or "/sbin" are automatically converted to their parent directories.


.nf
   PATH
.fi

5. Search project build trees recently configured in a CMake GUI.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH is passed.  It is intended for the case when a user is building multiple dependent projects one after another.


6. Search paths stored in the CMake user package registry.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY is passed.  Paths are stored in the registry when CMake configures a project that invokes export(PACKAGE <name>).  See the export(PACKAGE) command documentation for more details.


7. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files for the current system.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.


.nf
   CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
   CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH
   CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH
.fi

8. Search paths specified by the PATHS option.  These are typically hard\-coded guesses.


On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake variable    CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or one of the following:


.nf
   "FIRST"  \- Try to find frameworks before standard
              libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
   "LAST"   \- Try to find frameworks after standard

   "ONLY"   \- Only try to find frameworks.
   "NEVER" \- Never try to find frameworks.
.fi

On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of the following:


.nf
   "FIRST"  \- Try to find application bundles before standard
              programs. This is the default on Darwin.
   "LAST"   \- Try to find application bundles after standard
              programs.
   "ONLY"   \- Only try to find application bundles.
   "NEVER" \- Never try to find application bundles.
.fi

The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more directories to be prepended to all other search directories. This effectively "re\-roots" the entire search under given locations. By default it is empty. It is especially useful when cross\-compiling to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will search there too. By default at first the directories listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non\-rooted directories will be searched. The default behavior can be adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE.  This behavior can be manually overridden on a per\-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re\-rooted directories will be searched.


The default search order is designed to be most\-specific to least\-specific for common use cases.  Projects may override the order by simply calling the command multiple times and using the NO_* options:


.nf
   find_package(<package> PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
   find_package(<package>)
.fi

Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search again.


See the cmake_policy() command documentation for discussion of the NO_POLICY_SCOPE option.

.B find_path
Find the directory containing a file.

.nf
   find_path(<VAR> name1 [path1 path2 ...])

This command is used to find a directory containing the named file. A cache entry named by <VAR> is created to store the result of this command.  If the file in a directory is found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If nothing is found, the result will be <VAR>\-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again the next time find_path is invoked with the same variable.  The name of the file in a directory that is searched for is specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.   Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment variable var will be read and converted from a system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths.  For example ENV PATH would be a way to list the system path variable. The argument after DOC will be used for the documentation string in the cache.  PATH_SUFFIXES specifies additional subdirectories to check below each search path.


If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is specified, then no additional paths are added to the search. If NO_DEFAULT_PATH is not specified, the search process is as follows:


1. Search paths specified in cmake\-specific cache variables.  These are intended to be used on the command line with a \-DVAR=value.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_PATH is passed.


.nf
   <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
   CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
   CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
.fi

2. Search paths specified in cmake\-specific environment variables.  These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is passed.


.nf
   <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
   CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
   CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
.fi

3. Search the paths specified by the HINTS option.  These should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided by the location of another item already found.  Hard\-coded guesses should be specified with the PATHS option.


4. Search the standard system environment variables. This can be skipped if NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH is an argument.


.nf
   PATH
   INCLUDE
.fi

5. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files for the current system.  This can be skipped if NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH is passed.


.nf
   <prefix>/include for each <prefix> in CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
   CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
   CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH
.fi

6. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option or in the short\-hand version of the command.  These are typically hard\-coded guesses.


On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Frameworks, the cmake variable    CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK can be set to empty or one of the following:


.nf
   "FIRST"  \- Try to find frameworks before standard
              libraries or headers. This is the default on Darwin.
   "LAST"   \- Try to find frameworks after standard
              libraries or headers.
   "ONLY"   \- Only try to find frameworks.
   "NEVER" \- Never try to find frameworks.
.fi

On Darwin or systems supporting OS X Application Bundles, the cmake variable CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE can be set to empty or one of the following:


.nf
   "FIRST"  \- Try to find application bundles before standard
              programs. This is the default on Darwin.
   "LAST"   \- Try to find application bundles after standard
              programs.
   "ONLY"   \- Only try to find application bundles.
   "NEVER" \- Never try to find application bundles.
.fi

The CMake variable CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH specifies one or more directories to be prepended to all other search directories. This effectively "re\-roots" the entire search under given locations. By default it is empty. It is especially useful when cross\-compiling to point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will search there too. By default at first the directories listed in CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and then the non\-rooted directories will be searched. The default behavior can be adjusted by setting CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE.  This behavior can be manually overridden on a per\-call basis. By using CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH the search order will be as described above. If NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH will not be used. If ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is used then only the re\-rooted directories will be searched.


The default search order is designed to be most\-specific to least\-specific for common use cases.  Projects may override the order by simply calling the command multiple times and using the NO_* options:


.nf
   find_path(<VAR> NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
   find_path(<VAR> NAMES name)
.fi

Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set and stored in the cache so that no call will search again.


When searching for frameworks, if the file is specified as A/b.h, then the framework search will look for A.framework/Headers/b.h. If that is found the path will be set to the path to the framework. CMake will convert this to the correct \-F option to include the file. 

.TP
.B find_program
Find an executable program.

.nf
   find_program(<VAR> name1 [path1 path2 ...])
.fi

This is the short\-hand signature for the command that is sufficient in many cases.  It is the same as find_program(<VAR> name1 [PATHS path1 path2 ...])


.nf
   find_program(
             <VAR>
             name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
             [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
             [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
             [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
             [DOC "cache documentation string"]
             [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]

              ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
              NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
            )
.fi

This command is used to find a program. A cache entry named by <VAR> is created to store the result of this command.  If the program is found the result is stored in the variable and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.  If nothing is found, the result will be <VAR>\-NOTFOUND, and the search will be attempted again the next time find_program is invoked with the same variable.  The name of the program that is searched for is specified by the names listed after the NAMES argument.   Additional search locations can be specified after the PATHS argument.  If ENV var is found in the HINTS or PATHS section the environment variable var will be read and converted from a system environment variable to a cmake style list of paths.

.TP
.B fltk_wrap_ui
Create FLTK user interfaces Wrappers.

.nf
  fltk_wrap_ui(resultingLibraryName source1
               source2 ... sourceN )
.fi

Produce .h and .cxx files for all the .fl and .fld files listed.  The resulting .h and .cxx files will be added to a variable named resultingLibraryName_FLTK_UI_SRCS which should be added to your library.

.TP
.B foreach
Evaluate a group of commands for each value in a list.

.nf
  foreach(loop_var arg1 arg2 ...)
    COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
    COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
    ...
  endforeach(loop_var)
.fi

All commands between foreach and the matching endforeach are recorded without being invoked.  Once the endforeach is evaluated, the recorded list of commands is invoked once for each argument listed in the original foreach command.  Before each iteration of the loop "${loop_var}" will be set as a variable with the current value in the list.


.nf
  foreach(loop_var RANGE total)
  foreach(loop_var RANGE start stop [step])
.fi

Foreach can also iterate over a generated range of numbers. There are three types of this iteration:


* When specifying single number, the range will have elements 0 to "total".


* When specifying two numbers, the range will have elements from the first number to the second number.


* The third optional number is the increment used to iterate from the first number to the second number.


.nf
  foreach(loop_var IN [LISTS [list1 [...]]]
                      [ITEMS [item1 [...]]])
.fi

Iterates over a precise list of items.  The LISTS option names list\-valued variables to be traversed, including empty elements (an empty string is a zero\-length list).  The ITEMS option ends argument parsing and includes all arguments following it in the iteration.

.TP
.B function
Start recording a function for later invocation as a command.

.nf
  function(<name> [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
    COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
    COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
    ...
  endfunction(<name>)
.fi

Define a function named <name> that takes arguments named arg1 arg2 arg3 (...).  Commands listed after function, but before the matching endfunction, are not invoked until the function is invoked.  When it is invoked, the commands recorded in the function are first modified by replacing formal parameters (${arg1}) with the arguments passed, and then invoked as normal commands. In addition to referencing the formal parameters you can reference the variable ARGC which will be set to the number of arguments passed into the function as well as ARGV0 ARGV1 ARGV2 ... which will have the actual values of the arguments passed in. This facilitates creating functions with optional arguments. Additionally ARGV holds the list of all arguments given to the function and ARGN holds the list of argument past the last expected argument.


See the cmake_policy() command documentation for the behavior of policies inside functions.

.TP
.B get_cmake_property
Get a property of the CMake instance.

.nf
  get_cmake_property(VAR property)
.fi

Get a property from the CMake instance.  The value of the property is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is not found, CMake will report an error. Some supported properties include: VARIABLES, CACHE_VARIABLES, COMMANDS, MACROS, and COMPONENTS.

.TP
.B get_directory_property
Get a property of DIRECTORY scope.

.nf
  get_directory_property(<variable> [DIRECTORY <dir>] <prop\-name>)
.fi

Store a property of directory scope in the named variable.  If the property is not defined the empty\-string is returned.  The DIRECTORY argument specifies another directory from which to retrieve the property value.  The specified directory must have already been traversed by CMake.


.nf
  get_directory_property(<variable> [DIRECTORY <dir>]
                         DEFINITION <var\-name>)
.fi

Get a variable definition from a directory.  This form is useful to get a variable definition from another directory.

.TP
.B get_filename_component
Get a specific component of a full filename.

.nf
  get_filename_component(VarName FileName
                         PATH|ABSOLUTE|NAME|EXT|NAME_WE|REALPATH
                         [CACHE])
.fi

Set VarName to be the path (PATH), file name (NAME), file extension (EXT), file name without extension (NAME_WE) of FileName, the full path (ABSOLUTE), or the full path with all symlinks resolved (REALPATH).  Note that the path is converted to Unix slashes format and has no trailing slashes. The longest file extension is always considered. If the optional CACHE argument is specified, the result variable is added to the cache.


.nf
  get_filename_component(VarName FileName
                         PROGRAM [PROGRAM_ARGS ArgVar]
                         [CACHE])
.fi

The program in FileName will be found in the system search path or left as a full path.  If PROGRAM_ARGS is present with PROGRAM, then any command\-line arguments present in the FileName string are split from the program name and stored in ArgVar.  This is used to separate a program name from its arguments in a command line string.

.TP
.B get_property
Get a property.

.nf
  get_property(<variable>
               <GLOBAL             |
                DIRECTORY [dir]    |
                TARGET    <target> |
                SOURCE    <source> |
                TEST      <test>   |
                CACHE     <entry>  |
                VARIABLE>
               PROPERTY <name>
               [SET | DEFINED | BRIEF_DOCS | FULL_DOCS])
.fi

Get one property from one object in a scope.  The first argument specifies the variable in which to store the result.  The second argument determines the scope from which to get the property.  It must be one of the following:


GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.


DIRECTORY scope defaults to the current directory but another directory (already processed by CMake) may be named by full or relative path.


TARGET scope must name one existing target.


SOURCE scope must name one source file.


TEST scope must name one existing test.


CACHE scope must name one cache entry.


VARIABLE scope is unique and does not accept a name.


The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by the name of the property to get.  If the property is not set an empty value is returned.  If the SET option is given the variable is set to a boolean value indicating whether the property has been set.  If the DEFINED option is given the variable is set to a boolean value indicating whether the property has been defined such as with define_property. If BRIEF_DOCS or FULL_DOCS is given then the variable is set to a string containing documentation for the requested property.  If documentation is requested for a property that has not been defined NOTFOUND is returned.

.TP
.B get_source_file_property
Get a property for a source file.

.nf
  get_source_file_property(VAR file property)
.fi

Get a property from a source file.  The value of the property is stored in the variable VAR.  If the property is not found, VAR will be set to "NOTFOUND". Use set_source_files_properties to set property values.  Source file properties usually control how the file is built. One property that is always there is LOCATION

.TP
.B get_target_property
Get a property from a target.

.nf
  get_target_property(VAR target property)
.fi

Get a property from a target.   The value of the property is stored in the variable VAR.  If the property is not found, VAR will be set to "NOTFOUND".  Use set_target_properties to set property values.  Properties are usually used to control how a target is built, but some query the target instead.  This command can get properties for any target so far created. The targets do not need to be in the current CMakeLists.txt file.

.TP
.B get_test_property
Get a property of the test.

.nf
  get_test_property(test VAR property)
.fi

Get a property from the Test.  The value of the property is stored in the variable VAR. If the property is not found, CMake will report an error. For a list of standard properties you can type cmake \-\-help\-property\-list

.TP
.B if
Conditionally execute a group of commands.

.nf
  if(expression)

    ...
  else(expression)
    # else section.
    COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
    COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
    ...
  endif(expression)
.fi

Evaluates the given expression.  If the result is true, the commands in the THEN section are invoked.  Otherwise, the commands in the else section are invoked.  The elseif and else sections are optional. You may have multiple elseif clauses. Note that the expression in the else and endif clause is optional. Long expressions can be used and there is a traditional order of precedence. Parenthetical expressions are evaluated first followed by unary operators such as EXISTS, COMMAND, and DEFINED. Then any EQUAL, LESS, GREATER, STRLESS, STRGREATER, STREQUAL, MATCHES will be evaluated. Then NOT operators and finally AND, OR operators will be evaluated. Possible expressions are:


.nf
  if(<constant>)
.fi

True if the constant is 1, ON, YES, TRUE, Y, or a non\-zero number.  False if the constant is 0, OFF, NO, FALSE, N, IGNORE, "", or ends in the suffix '\-NOTFOUND'.  Named boolean constants are case\-insensitive.


.nf
  if(<variable>)
.fi

True if the variable's value is not a false constant.


.nf
  if(NOT <expression>)
.fi

True if the expression is not true.


.nf
  if(<expr1> AND <expr2>)

True if the given name is an existing target, built or imported.


.nf
  if(EXISTS file\-name)
  if(EXISTS directory\-name)
.fi

True if the named file or directory exists.  Behavior is well\-defined only for full paths.


.nf
  if(file1 IS_NEWER_THAN file2)
.fi

True if file1 is newer than file2 or if one of the two files doesn't exist. Behavior is well\-defined only for full paths.


.nf
  if(IS_DIRECTORY directory\-name)
.fi

True if the given name is a directory.  Behavior is well\-defined only for full paths.


.nf
  if(IS_ABSOLUTE path)
.fi

True if the given path is an absolute path.

.nf
  if(version1 VERSION_LESS version2)
  if(version1 VERSION_EQUAL version2)

Component\-wise integer version number comparison (version format is major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]).


.nf
  if(DEFINED variable)
.fi

True if the given variable is defined. It does not matter if the variable is true or false just if it has been set.


.nf
  if((expression) AND (expression OR (expression)))
.fi

The expressions inside the parenthesis are evaluated first and then the remaining expression is evaluated as in the previous examples. Where there are nested parenthesis the innermost are evaluated as part of evaluating the expression that contains them.


The if statement was written fairly early in CMake's history and it has some convenience features that are worth covering. The if statement reduces operations until there is a single remaining value, at that point if the case insensitive value is: ON, 1, YES, TRUE, Y it returns true, if it is OFF, 0, NO, FALSE, N, NOTFOUND, *\-NOTFOUND, IGNORE it will return false. 


This is fairly reasonable. The convenience feature that sometimes throws new authors is how CMake handles values that do not match the true or false list. Those values are treated as variables and are dereferenced even though they do not have the required ${} syntax. This means that if you write


.nf
  if (boobah)
.fi

CMake will treat it as if you wrote 


.nf
  if (${boobah})
.fi

likewise if you write 


.nf
  if (fubar AND sol)
.fi

CMake will conveniently treat it as 


.nf
  if ("${fubar}" AND "${sol}")
.fi

The later is really the correct way to write it, but the former will work as well. Only some operations in the if statement have this special handling of arguments. The specific details follow: 


1) The left hand argument to MATCHES is first checked to see if it is a defined variable, if so the variable's value is used, otherwise the original value is used. 


2) If the left hand argument to MATCHES is missing it returns false without error 


3) Both left and right hand arguments to LESS GREATER EQUAL are independently tested to see if they are defined variables, if so their defined values are used otherwise the original value is used. 


4) Both left and right hand arguments to STRLESS STREQUAL STRGREATER are independently tested to see if they are defined variables, if so their defined values are used otherwise the original value is used. 


5) Both left and right hand argumemnts to VERSION_LESS VERSION_EQUAL VERSION_GREATER are independently tested to see if they are defined variables, if so their defined values are used otherwise the original value is used. 


6) The right hand argument to NOT is tested to see if it is a boolean constant, if so the value is used, otherwise it is assumed to be a variable and it is dereferenced. 


7) The left and right hand arguments to AND OR are independently tested to see if they are boolean constants, if so they are used as such, otherwise they are assumed to be variables and are dereferenced. 


.TP
.B include
Read CMake listfile code from the given file.

.nf
  include(<file|module> [OPTIONAL] [RESULT_VARIABLE <VAR>]
                        [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])
.fi

Reads CMake listfile code from the given file.  Commands in the file are processed immediately as if they were written in place of the include command.  If OPTIONAL is present, then no error is raised if the file does not exist.  If RESULT_VARIABLE is given the variable will be set to the full filename which has been included or NOTFOUND if it failed.


If a module is specified instead of a file, the file with name <modulename>.cmake is searched in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.

Add include directories to the build.

.nf
  include_directories([AFTER|BEFORE] [SYSTEM] dir1 dir2 ...)
.fi

Add the given directories to those searched by the compiler for include files. By default the directories are appended onto the current list of directories. This default behavior can be changed by setting CMAKE_include_directories_BEFORE to ON. By using BEFORE or AFTER you can select between appending and prepending, independent from the default. If the SYSTEM option is given the compiler will be told that the directories are meant as system include directories on some platforms.

.TP
.B include_external_msproject
Include an external Microsoft project file in a workspace.

.nf
  include_external_msproject(projectname location
                             dep1 dep2 ...)
.fi

Includes an external Microsoft project in the generated workspace file.  Currently does nothing on UNIX. This will create a target named INCLUDE_EXTERNAL_MSPROJECT_[projectname].  This can be used in the add_dependencies command to make things depend on the external project.

.TP
.B include_regular_expression
Set the regular expression used for dependency checking.

.nf
  include_regular_expression(regex_match [regex_complain])
.fi

Set the regular expressions used in dependency checking.  Only files matching regex_match will be traced as dependencies.  Only files matching regex_complain will generate warnings if they cannot be found (standard header paths are not searched).  The defaults are:


.nf
  regex_match    = "^.*$" (match everything)
  regex_complain = "^$" (match empty string only)
.fi

.TP
.B install
Specify rules to run at install time.

This command generates installation rules for a project.  Rules specified by calls to this command within a source directory are executed in order during installation.  The order across directories is not defined.


There are multiple signatures for this command.  Some of them define installation properties for files and targets.  Properties common to multiple signatures are covered here but they are valid only for signatures that specify them.


DESTINATION arguments specify the directory on disk to which a file will be installed.  If a full path (with a leading slash or drive letter) is given it is used directly.  If a relative path is given it is interpreted relative to the value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.


PERMISSIONS arguments specify permissions for installed files.  Valid permissions are OWNER_READ, OWNER_WRITE, OWNER_EXECUTE, GROUP_READ, GROUP_WRITE, GROUP_EXECUTE, WORLD_READ, WORLD_WRITE, WORLD_EXECUTE, SETUID, and SETGID.  Permissions that do not make sense on certain platforms are ignored on those platforms.


The CONFIGURATIONS argument specifies a list of build configurations for which the install rule applies (Debug, Release, etc.).


The COMPONENT argument specifies an installation component name with which the install rule is associated, such as "runtime" or "development".  During component\-specific installation only install rules associated with the given component name will be executed.  During a full installation all components are installed.


The RENAME argument specifies a name for an installed file that may be different from the original file.  Renaming is allowed only when a single file is installed by the command.


The OPTIONAL argument specifies that it is not an error if the file to be installed does not exist.  


The TARGETS signature:


.nf
  install(TARGETS targets... [EXPORT <export\-name>]
          [[ARCHIVE|LIBRARY|RUNTIME|FRAMEWORK|BUNDLE|
            PRIVATE_HEADER|PUBLIC_HEADER|RESOURCE]
           [DESTINATION <dir>]
           [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
           [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
           [COMPONENT <component>]
           [OPTIONAL] [NAMELINK_ONLY|NAMELINK_SKIP]
          ] [...])
.fi

The TARGETS form specifies rules for installing targets from a project.  There are five kinds of target files that may be installed: ARCHIVE, LIBRARY, RUNTIME, FRAMEWORK, and BUNDLE.  Executables are treated as RUNTIME targets, except that those marked with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property are treated as BUNDLE targets on OS X. Static libraries are always treated as ARCHIVE targets. Module libraries are always treated as LIBRARY targets. For non\-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as LIBRARY targets, except that those marked with the FRAMEWORK property are treated as FRAMEWORK targets on OS X.  For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a RUNTIME target and the corresponding import library is treated as an ARCHIVE target. All Windows\-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms. The ARCHIVE, LIBRARY, RUNTIME, and FRAMEWORK arguments change the type of target to which the subsequent properties apply.  If none is given the installation properties apply to all target types.  If only one is given then only targets of that type will be installed (which can be used to install just a DLL or just an import library).


The PRIVATE_HEADER, PUBLIC_HEADER, and RESOURCE arguments cause subsequent properties to be applied to installing a FRAMEWORK shared library target's associated files on non\-Apple platforms.  Rules defined by these arguments are ignored on Apple platforms because the associated files are installed into the appropriate locations inside the framework folder.  See documentation of the PRIVATE_HEADER, PUBLIC_HEADER, and RESOURCE target properties for details.


Either NAMELINK_ONLY or NAMELINK_SKIP may be specified as a LIBRARY option.  On some platforms a versioned shared library has a symbolic link such as


.nf
  lib<name>.so \-> lib<name>.so.1
.fi

where "lib<name>.so.1" is the soname of the library and "lib<name>.so" is a "namelink" allowing linkers to find the library when given "\-l<name>".  The NAMELINK_ONLY option causes installation of only the namelink when a library target is installed.  The NAMELINK_SKIP option causes installation of library files other than the namelink when a library target is installed.  When neither option is given both portions are installed.  On platforms where versioned shared libraries do not have namelinks or when a library is not versioned the NAMELINK_SKIP option installs the library and the NAMELINK_ONLY option installs nothing.  See the VERSION and SOVERSION target properties for details on creating versioned shared libraries.


One or more groups of properties may be specified in a single call to the TARGETS form of this command.  A target may be installed more than once to different locations.  Consider hypothetical targets "myExe", "mySharedLib", and "myStaticLib".  The code


.nf
    install(TARGETS myExe mySharedLib myStaticLib
            RUNTIME DESTINATION bin
            LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
            ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib/static)
    install(TARGETS mySharedLib DESTINATION /some/full/path)
.fi

will install myExe to <prefix>/bin and myStaticLib to <prefix>/lib/static.  On non\-DLL platforms mySharedLib will be installed to <prefix>/lib and /some/full/path.  On DLL platforms the mySharedLib DLL will be installed to <prefix>/bin and /some/full/path and its import library will be installed to <prefix>/lib/static and /some/full/path. On non\-DLL platforms mySharedLib will be installed to <prefix>/lib and /some/full/path.


The EXPORT option associates the installed target files with an export called <export\-name>.  It must appear before any RUNTIME, LIBRARY, or ARCHIVE options.  See documentation of the install(EXPORT ...) signature below for details.


Installing a target with EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true has undefined behavior.


The FILES signature:


.nf
  install(FILES files... DESTINATION <dir>
          [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
          [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
          [COMPONENT <component>]
          [RENAME <name>] [OPTIONAL])
.fi

The FILES form specifies rules for installing files for a project.  File names given as relative paths are interpreted with respect to the current source directory.  Files installed by this form are by default given permissions OWNER_WRITE, OWNER_READ, GROUP_READ, and WORLD_READ if no PERMISSIONS argument is given.


The PROGRAMS signature:


.nf
  install(PROGRAMS files... DESTINATION <dir>
          [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
          [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
          [COMPONENT <component>]
          [RENAME <name>] [OPTIONAL])
.fi

The PROGRAMS form is identical to the FILES form except that the default permissions for the installed file also include OWNER_EXECUTE, GROUP_EXECUTE, and WORLD_EXECUTE.  This form is intended to install programs that are not targets, such as shell scripts.  Use the TARGETS form to install targets built within the project.


The DIRECTORY signature:


.nf
  install(DIRECTORY dirs... DESTINATION <dir>
          [FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
          [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
          [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [OPTIONAL]
          [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
          [COMPONENT <component>] [FILES_MATCHING]
          [[PATTERN <pattern> | REGEX <regex>]
           [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]] [...])
.fi

The DIRECTORY form installs contents of one or more directories to a given destination.  The directory structure is copied verbatim to the destination.  The last component of each directory name is appended to the destination directory but a trailing slash may be used to avoid this because it leaves the last component empty.  Directory names given as relative paths are interpreted with respect to the current source directory.  If no input directory names are given the destination directory will be created but nothing will be installed into it.  The FILE_PERMISSIONS and DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS options specify permissions given to files and directories in the destination.  If USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS is specified and FILE_PERMISSIONS is not, file permissions will be copied from the source directory structure.  If no permissions are specified files will be given the default permissions specified in the FILES form of the command, and the directories will be given the default permissions specified in the PROGRAMS form of the command.


Installation of directories may be controlled with fine granularity using the PATTERN or REGEX options.  These "match" options specify a globbing pattern or regular expression to match directories or files encountered within input directories.  They may be used to apply certain options (see below) to a subset of the files and directories encountered.  The full path to each input file or directory (with forward slashes) is matched against the expression.  A PATTERN will match only complete file names: the portion of the full path matching the pattern must occur at the end of the file name and be preceded by a slash.  A REGEX will match any portion of the full path but it may use '/' and '$' to simulate the PATTERN behavior.  By default all files and directories are installed whether or not they are matched.  The FILES_MATCHING option may be given before the first match option to disable installation of files (but not directories) not matched by any expression.  For example, the code


.nf
  install(DIRECTORY src/ DESTINATION include/myproj
          FILES_MATCHING PATTERN "*.h")
.fi

will extract and install header files from a source tree.


Some options may follow a PATTERN or REGEX expression and are applied only to files or directories matching them.  The EXCLUDE option will skip the matched file or directory.  The PERMISSIONS option overrides the permissions setting for the matched file or directory.  For example the code


.nf
  install(DIRECTORY icons scripts/ DESTINATION share/myproj
          PATTERN "CVS" EXCLUDE
          PATTERN "scripts/*"
          PERMISSIONS OWNER_EXECUTE OWNER_WRITE OWNER_READ
                      GROUP_EXECUTE GROUP_READ)
.fi

will install the icons directory to share/myproj/icons and the scripts directory to share/myproj.  The icons will get default file permissions, the scripts will be given specific permissions, and any CVS directories will be excluded.


The SCRIPT and CODE signature:


.nf
  install([[SCRIPT <file>] [CODE <code>]] [...])
.fi

The SCRIPT form will invoke the given CMake script files during installation.  If the script file name is a relative path it will be interpreted with respect to the current source directory.  The CODE form will invoke the given CMake code during installation.  Code is specified as a single argument inside a double\-quoted string. For example, the code


.nf
  install(CODE "MESSAGE(\\"Sample install message.\\")")
.fi

will print a message during installation.


The EXPORT signature:


.nf
  install(EXPORT <export\-name> DESTINATION <dir>
          [NAMESPACE <namespace>] [FILE <name>.cmake]
          [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
          [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
          [COMPONENT <component>])
.fi

The EXPORT form generates and installs a CMake file containing code to import targets from the installation tree into another project.  Target installations are associated with the export <export\-name> using the EXPORT option of the install(TARGETS ...) signature documented above.  The NAMESPACE option will prepend <namespace> to the target names as they are written to the import file.  By default the generated file will be called <export\-name>.cmake but the FILE option may be used to specify a different name.  The value given to the FILE option must be a file name with the ".cmake" extension.  If a CONFIGURATIONS option is given then the file will only be installed when one of the named configurations is installed.  Additionally, the generated import file will reference only the matching target configurations.  If a COMPONENT option is specified that does not match that given to the targets associated with <export\-name> the behavior is undefined.  If a library target is included in the export but a target to which it links is not included the behavior is unspecified.


The EXPORT form is useful to help outside projects use targets built and installed by the current project.  For example, the code


.nf
  install(TARGETS myexe EXPORT myproj DESTINATION bin)
  install(EXPORT myproj NAMESPACE mp_ DESTINATION lib/myproj)
.fi

will install the executable myexe to <prefix>/bin and code to import it in the file "<prefix>/lib/myproj/myproj.cmake".  An outside project may load this file with the include command and reference the myexe executable from the installation tree using the imported target name mp_myexe as if the target were built in its own tree.


NOTE: This command supercedes the INSTALL_TARGETS command and the target properties PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT.  It also replaces the FILES forms of the INSTALL_FILES and INSTALL_PROGRAMS commands.  The processing order of these install rules relative to those generated by INSTALL_TARGETS, INSTALL_FILES, and INSTALL_PROGRAMS commands is not defined.


.TP
.B link_directories
Specify directories in which the linker will look for libraries.

.nf
  link_directories(directory1 directory2 ...)
.fi

Specify the paths in which the linker should search for libraries. The command will apply only to targets created after it is called. For historical reasons, relative paths given to this command are passed to the linker unchanged (unlike many CMake commands which interpret them relative to the current source directory).

.TP
.B list
List operations.

.nf
  list(LENGTH <list> <output variable>)
  list(GET <list> <element index> [<element index> ...]
       <output variable>)
  list(APPEND <list> <element> [<element> ...])
  list(FIND <list> <value> <output variable>)
  list(INSERT <list> <element_index> <element> [<element> ...])
  list(REMOVE_ITEM <list> <value> [<value> ...])
  list(REMOVE_AT <list> <index> [<index> ...])
  list(REMOVE_DUPLICATES <list>)
  list(REVERSE <list>)
  list(SORT <list>)
.fi

LENGTH will return a given list's length.


GET will return list of elements specified by indices from the list.


APPEND will append elements to the list.


FIND will return the index of the element specified in the list or \-1 if it wasn't found.


INSERT will insert elements to the list to the specified location.


REMOVE_AT and REMOVE_ITEM will remove items from the list. The difference is that REMOVE_ITEM will remove the given items, while REMOVE_AT will remove the items at the given indices.


REMOVE_DUPLICATES will remove duplicated items in the list.


REVERSE reverses the contents of the list in\-place.


SORT sorts the list in\-place alphabetically.


NOTES: A list in cmake is a ; separated group of strings. To create a list the set command can be used. For example, set(var a b c d e)  creates a list with a;b;c;d;e, and set(var "a b c d e") creates a string or a list with one item in it.


When specifying index values, if <element index> is 0 or greater, it is indexed from the beginning of the list, with 0 representing the first list element. If <element index> is \-1 or lesser, it is indexed from the end of the list, with \-1 representing the last list element. Be careful when counting with negative indices: they do not start from 0. \-0 is equivalent to 0, the first list element.


.TP
.B load_cache
Load in the values from another project's CMake cache.

.nf
  load_cache(pathToCacheFile READ_WITH_PREFIX
             prefix entry1...)
.fi

Read the cache and store the requested entries in variables with their name prefixed with the given prefix.  This only reads the values, and does not create entries in the local project's cache.


.nf
  load_cache(pathToCacheFile [EXCLUDE entry1...]
             [INCLUDE_INTERNALS entry1...])
.fi

Load in the values from another cache and store them in the local project's cache as internal entries.  This is useful for a project that depends on another project built in a different tree.  EXCLUDE option can be used to provide a list of entries to be excluded.  INCLUDE_INTERNALS can be used to provide a list of internal entries to be included.  Normally, no internal entries are brought in.  Use of this form of the command is strongly discouraged, but it is provided for backward compatibility.

.TP
.B load_command
Load a command into a running CMake.

.nf
  load_command(COMMAND_NAME <loc1> [loc2 ...])
.fi

The given locations are searched for a library whose name is cmCOMMAND_NAME.  If found, it is loaded as a module and the command is added to the set of available CMake commands.  Usually, TRY_COMPILE is used before this command to compile the module. If the command is successfully loaded a variable named


.nf
  CMAKE_LOADED_COMMAND_<COMMAND_NAME>
.fi

will be set to the full path of the module that was loaded.  Otherwise the variable will not be set.

.TP
.B macro
Start recording a macro for later invocation as a command.

.nf
  macro(<name> [arg1 [arg2 [arg3 ...]]])
    COMMAND1(ARGS ...)
    COMMAND2(ARGS ...)
    ...
  endmacro(<name>)
.fi

Define a macro named <name> that takes arguments named arg1 arg2 arg3 (...).  Commands listed after macro, but before the matching endmacro, are not invoked until the macro is invoked.  When it is invoked, the commands recorded in the macro are first modified by replacing formal parameters (${arg1}) with the arguments passed, and then invoked as normal commands. In addition to referencing the formal parameters you can reference the values ${ARGC} which will be set to the number of arguments passed into the function as well as ${ARGV0} ${ARGV1} ${ARGV2} ... which will have the actual values of the arguments passed in. This facilitates creating macros with optional arguments. Additionally ${ARGV} holds the list of all arguments given to the macro and ${ARGN} holds the list of argument past the last expected argument. Note that the parameters to a macro and values such as ARGN are not variables in the usual CMake sense. They are string replacements much like the c preprocessor would do with a macro. If you want true CMake variables you should look at the function command.


See the cmake_policy() command documentation for the behavior of policies inside macros.

.TP
.B mark_as_advanced
Mark cmake cached variables as advanced.

.nf
  mark_as_advanced([CLEAR|FORCE] VAR VAR2 VAR...)
.fi

Mark the named cached variables as advanced.  An advanced variable will not be displayed in any of the cmake GUIs unless the show advanced option is on.  If CLEAR is the first argument advanced variables are changed back to unadvanced.  If FORCE is the first argument, then the variable is made advanced.  If neither FORCE nor CLEAR is specified, new values will be marked as advanced, but if the variable already has an advanced/non\-advanced state, it will not be changed.


It does nothing in script mode.

.TP
.B math
Mathematical expressions.

.nf
  math(EXPR <output variable> <math expression>)
.fi

EXPR evaluates mathematical expression and return result in the output variable. Example mathematical expression is '5 * ( 10 + 13 )'.  Supported operators are + \- * / % | & ^ ~ << >> * / %.  They have the same meaning  as they do in c code.

.TP
.B message
Display a message to the user.

.nf
  message([STATUS|WARNING|AUTHOR_WARNING|FATAL_ERROR|SEND_ERROR]
          "message to display" ...)
.fi

The optional keyword determines the type of message:


.nf
  (none)         = Important information
  STATUS         = Incidental information
  WARNING        = CMake Warning, continue processing
  AUTHOR_WARNING = CMake Warning (dev), continue processing
  SEND_ERROR     = CMake Error, continue but skip generation
  FATAL_ERROR    = CMake Error, stop all processing
.fi

The CMake command\-line tool displays STATUS messages on stdout and all other message types on stderr.  The CMake GUI displays all messages in its log area.  The interactive dialogs (ccmake and CMakeSetup) show STATUS messages one at a time on a status line and other messages in interactive pop\-up boxes.


CMake Warning and Error message text displays using a simple markup language.  Non\-indented text is formatted in line\-wrapped paragraphs delimited by newlines.  Indented text is considered pre\-formatted.

.TP
.B option
Provides an option that the user can optionally select.

.nf
  option(<option_variable> "help string describing option"
         [initial value])
.fi

Provide an option for the user to select as ON or OFF.  If no initial value is provided, OFF is used.

.TP
.B output_required_files
Output a list of required source files for a specified source file.

.nf
  output_required_files(srcfile outputfile)
.fi

Outputs a list of all the source files that are required by the specified srcfile. This list is written into outputfile. This is similar to writing out the dependencies for srcfile except that it jumps from .h files into .cxx, .c and .cpp files if possible.

.TP
.B project
Set a name for the entire project.

.nf
  project(<projectname> [languageName1 languageName2 ... ] )
.fi

Sets the name of the project.  Additionally this sets the variables <projectName>_BINARY_DIR and <projectName>_SOURCE_DIR to the respective values.


Optionally you can specify which languages your project supports.  Example languages are CXX (i.e. C++), C, Fortran, etc. By default C and CXX are enabled.  E.g. if you do not have a C++ compiler, you can disable the check for it by explicitely listing the languages you want to support, e.g. C.  By using the special language "NONE" all checks for any language can be disabled.

.TP
.B qt_wrap_cpp
Create Qt Wrappers.

.nf
  qt_wrap_cpp(resultingLibraryName DestName
              SourceLists ...)
.fi

Produce moc files for all the .h files listed in the SourceLists.  The moc files will be added to the library using the DestName source list.

.TP
.B qt_wrap_ui
Create Qt user interfaces Wrappers.

.nf
  qt_wrap_ui(resultingLibraryName HeadersDestName
             SourcesDestName SourceLists ...)
.fi

Produce .h and .cxx files for all the .ui files listed in the SourceLists.  The .h files will be added to the library using the HeadersDestNamesource list.  The .cxx files will be added to the library using the SourcesDestNamesource list.

.TP
.B remove_definitions
Removes \-D define flags added by add_definitions.

.nf
  remove_definitions(\-DFOO \-DBAR ...)
.fi

Removes flags (added by add_definitions) from the compiler command line for sources in the current directory and below.

.TP
.B return
Return from a file, directory or function.

.nf
  return()
.fi

Returns from a file, directory or function. When this command is encountered in an included file (via include() or find_package()), it causes processing of the current file to stop and control is returned to the including file. If it is encountered in a file which is not included by another file, e.g. a CMakeLists.txt, control is returned to the parent directory if there is one. If return is called in a function, control is returned to the caller of the function. Note that a macro is not a function and does not handle return like a function does.

.TP
.B separate_arguments
Parse space\-separated arguments into a semicolon\-separated list.

.nf
  separate_arguments(<var> <UNIX|WINDOWS>_COMMAND "<args>")
.fi

Parses a unix\- or windows\-style command\-line string "<args>" and stores a semicolon\-separated list of the arguments in <var>.  The entire command line must be given in one "<args>" argument.


The UNIX_COMMAND mode separates arguments by unquoted whitespace.  It recognizes both single\-quote and double\-quote pairs.  A backslash escapes the next literal character (\\" is "); there are no special escapes (\\n is just n).


The WINDOWS_COMMAND mode parses a windows command\-line using the same syntax the runtime library uses to construct argv at startup.  It separates arguments by whitespace that is not double\-quoted.  Backslashes are literal unless they precede double\-quotes.  See the MSDN article "Parsing C Command\-Line Arguments" for details.


.nf
  separate_arguments(VARIABLE)
.fi

Convert the value of VARIABLE to a semi\-colon separated list.  All spaces are replaced with ';'.  This helps with generating command lines.

.TP
.B set
Set a CMAKE variable to a given value.

.nf
  set(<variable> <value>
      [[CACHE <type> <docstring> [FORCE]] | PARENT_SCOPE])
.fi

Within CMake sets <variable> to the value <value>.  <value> is expanded  before <variable> is set to it.  If CACHE is present, then the <variable> is put in the cache. <type> and <docstring> are then required. <type> is used by the CMake GUI to choose a widget with which the user sets a value.  The value for <type> may be one of


.nf
  FILEPATH = File chooser dialog.
  PATH     = Directory chooser dialog.
  STRING   = Arbitrary string.
  BOOL     = Boolean ON/OFF checkbox.
  INTERNAL = No GUI entry (used for persistent variables).
.fi

If <type> is INTERNAL, then the <value> is always written into the cache, replacing any values existing in the cache.  If it is not a cache variable, then this always writes into the current makefile. The FORCE option will overwrite the cache value removing any changes by the user.


If PARENT_SCOPE is present, the variable will be set in the scope above the current scope. Each new directory or function creates a new scope. This command will set the value of a variable into the parent directory or calling function (whichever is applicable to the case at hand).


If <value> is not specified then the variable is removed instead of set.  See also: the unset() command.


.nf
  set(<variable> <value1> ... <valueN>)
.fi

In this case <variable> is set to a semicolon separated list of values.


<variable> can be an environment variable such as:


.nf
  set( ENV{PATH} /home/martink )
.fi

in which case the environment variable will be set.

.TP
.B set_directory_properties
Set a property of the directory.

.nf
  set_directory_properties(PROPERTIES prop1 value1 prop2 value2)
.fi

Set a property for the current directory and subdirectories. If the property is not found, CMake will report an error. The properties include: INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES, INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION, and ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES. ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES is a list of files that will be cleaned as a part of "make clean" stage.

.TP
.B set_property
Set a named property in a given scope.

Set one property on zero or more objects of a scope.  The first argument determines the scope in which the property is set.  It must be one of the following:


GLOBAL scope is unique and does not accept a name.


DIRECTORY scope defaults to the current directory but another directory (already processed by CMake) may be named by full or relative path.


TARGET scope may name zero or more existing targets.


SOURCE scope may name zero or more source files.


TEST scope may name zero or more existing tests.


CACHE scope must name zero or more cache existing entries.


The required PROPERTY option is immediately followed by the name of the property to set.  Remaining arguments are used to compose the property value in the form of a semicolon\-separated list.  If the APPEND option is given the list is appended to any existing property value.

.B set_source_files_properties
Source files can have properties that affect how they are built.

Set properties on a file. The syntax for the command is to list all the files you want to change, and then provide the values you want to set next.  You can make up your own properties as well.  The following are used by CMake.  The ABSTRACT flag (boolean) is used by some class wrapping commands. If WRAP_EXCLUDE (boolean) is true then many wrapping commands will ignore this file. If GENERATED (boolean) is true then it is not an error if this source file does not exist when it is added to a target.  Obviously, it must be created (presumably by a custom command) before the target is built.  If the HEADER_FILE_ONLY (boolean) property is true then the file is not compiled.  This is useful if you want to add extra non build files to an IDE. OBJECT_DEPENDS (string) adds dependencies to the object file.  COMPILE_FLAGS (string) is passed to the compiler as additional command line arguments when the source file is compiled.  LANGUAGE (string) CXX|C will change the default compiler used to compile the source file. The languages used need to be enabled in the PROJECT command. If SYMBOLIC (boolean) is set to true the build system will be informed that the source file is not actually created on disk but instead used as a symbolic name for a build rule.

.TP
.B set_target_properties
Targets can have properties that affect how they are built.

.nf
  set_target_properties(target1 target2 ...
                        PROPERTIES prop1 value1
                        prop2 value2 ...)
.fi

Set properties on a target. The syntax for the command is to list all the files you want to change, and then provide the values you want to set next.  You can use any prop value pair you want and extract it later with the GET_TARGET_PROPERTY command.


Properties that affect the name of a target's output file are as follows.  The PREFIX and SUFFIX properties override the default target name prefix (such as "lib") and suffix (such as ".so"). IMPORT_PREFIX and IMPORT_SUFFIX are the equivalent properties for the import library corresponding to a DLL (for SHARED library targets).  OUTPUT_NAME sets the real name of a target when it is built and can be used to help create two targets of the same name even though CMake requires unique logical target names.  There is also a <CONFIG>_OUTPUT_NAME that can set the output name on a per\-configuration basis.  <CONFIG>_POSTFIX sets a postfix for the real name of the target when it is built under the configuration named by <CONFIG> (in upper\-case, such as "DEBUG_POSTFIX").  The value of this property is initialized when the target is created to the value of the variable CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX (except for executable targets because earlier CMake versions which did not use this variable for executables).


The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags to the link step of a target. LINK_FLAGS_<CONFIG> will add to the configuration <CONFIG>, for example, DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDEBINFO. DEFINE_SYMBOL sets the name of the preprocessor symbol defined when compiling sources in a shared library. If not set here then it is set to target_EXPORTS by default (with some substitutions if the target is not a valid C identifier). This is useful for headers to know whether they are being included from inside their library our outside to properly setup dllexport/dllimport decorations. The COMPILE_FLAGS property sets additional compiler flags used to build sources within the target.  It may also be used to pass additional preprocessor definitions.


The LINKER_LANGUAGE property is used to change the tool used to link an executable or shared library. The default is set the language to match the files in the library. CXX and C are common values for this property.


For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to specify the build version and api version respectively. When building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports symlinks and the linker supports so\-names. If only one of both is specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number. For executables VERSION can be used to specify the build version. When building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports symlinks. For shared libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION attribute is parsed to extract a "major.minor" version number. These numbers are used as the image version of the binary. 


There are a few properties used to specify RPATH rules. INSTALL_RPATH is a semicolon\-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed targets (for platforms that support it). INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true will append directories in the linker search path and outside the project to the INSTALL_RPATH. SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip automatic generation of an rpath allowing the target to run from the build tree. BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to link the target in the build tree with the INSTALL_RPATH.  This takes precedence over SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the need for relinking before installation.  INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a string specifying the directory portion of the "install_name" field of shared libraries on Mac OSX to use in the installed targets. When the target is created the values of the variables CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH, CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH, CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH, CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH, and CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR are used to initialize these properties.


PROJECT_LABEL can be used to change the name of the target in an IDE like visual studio.  VS_KEYWORD can be set to change the visual studio keyword, for example QT integration works better if this is set to Qt4VSv1.0.


VS_SCC_PROJECTNAME, VS_SCC_LOCALPATH, VS_SCC_PROVIDER can be set to add support for source control bindings in a  Visual Studio project file.


The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run before and after installing a target.  They are used only when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is used to install the target.  Use the INSTALL command instead.


The EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD property is used by the visual studio generators.  If it is set to 1 the target will not be part of the default build when you select "Build Solution".

.TP
.B set_tests_properties
Set a property of the tests.

.nf
  set_tests_properties(test1 [test2...] PROPERTIES prop1 value1 prop2 value2)
.fi

Set a property for the tests. If the property is not found, CMake will report an error. The properties include:


WILL_FAIL: If set to true, this will invert the pass/fail flag of the test.


PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION: If set, the test output will be checked against the specified regular expressions and at least one of the regular expressions has to match, otherwise the test will fail.


.nf
  Example: PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "TestPassed;All ok"
.fi

FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION: If set, if the output will match to one of specified regular expressions, the test will fail.


.nf
  Example: PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "[^a\-z]Error;ERROR;Failed"
.fi

Both PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION and FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION expect a list of regular expressions.


PROCESSORS: Denotes the number of processors that this test will require. This is typically used for MPI tests, and should be used in conjunction with the ctest_test PARALLEL_LEVEL option.


COST: Set this to a floating point value. Tests in a test set will be run in descending order of cost.


RUN_SERIAL: If set to true, this test will not run in parallel with any other tests. This should be used in conjunction with the ctest_test PARALLEL_LEVEL option.

.TP
.B source_group
Define a grouping for sources in the makefile.

.nf
  source_group(name [REGULAR_EXPRESSION regex] [FILES src1 src2 ...])
.fi

Defines a group into which sources will be placed in project files.  This is mainly used to setup file tabs in Visual Studio.  Any file whose name is listed or matches the regular expression will be placed in this group.  If a file matches multiple groups, the LAST group that explicitly lists the file will be favored, if any.  If no group explicitly lists the file, the LAST group whose regular expression matches the file will be favored.


The name of the group may contain backslashes to specify subgroups:


.nf
  source_group(outer\\\\inner ...)
.fi

For backwards compatibility, this command is also supports the format:


.nf
  source_group(name regex)
.fi

.TP
.B string
String operations.

.nf
  string(REGEX MATCH <regular_expression>

         <output variable> <input> [<input>...])
  string(REGEX REPLACE <regular_expression>
         <replace_expression> <output variable>
         <input> [<input>...])
  string(REPLACE <match_string>

  string(LENGTH <string> <output variable>)
  string(SUBSTRING <string> <begin> <length> <output variable>)
  string(STRIP <string> <output variable>)
  string(RANDOM [LENGTH <length>] [ALPHABET <alphabet>]
         [RANDOM_SEED <seed>] <output variable>)
.fi

REGEX MATCH will match the regular expression once and store the match in the output variable.


REGEX MATCHALL will match the regular expression as many times as possible and store the matches in the output variable as a list.


REGEX REPLACE will match the regular expression as many times as possible and substitute the replacement expression for the match in the output.  The replace expression may refer to paren\-delimited subexpressions of the match using \\1, \\2, ..., \\9.  Note that two backslashes (\\\\1) are required in CMake code to get a backslash through argument parsing.


REPLACE will replace all occurrences of match_string in the input with replace_string and store the result in the output.


COMPARE EQUAL/NOTEQUAL/LESS/GREATER will compare the strings and store true or false in the output variable.


ASCII will convert all numbers into corresponding ASCII characters.


CONFIGURE will transform a string like CONFIGURE_FILE transforms a file.


TOUPPER/TOLOWER will convert string to upper/lower characters.


LENGTH will return a given string's length.


SUBSTRING will return a substring of a given string.


STRIP will return a substring of a given string with leading and trailing spaces removed.


RANDOM will return a random string of given length consisting of characters from the given alphabet. Default length is 5 characters and default alphabet is all numbers and upper and lower case letters.  If an integer RANDOM_SEED is given, its value will be used to seed the random number generator.


The following characters have special meaning in regular expressions:


.nf
   ^         Matches at beginning of a line
   $         Matches at end of a line
   .         Matches any single character
   [ ]       Matches any character(s) inside the brackets
   [^ ]      Matches any character(s) not inside the brackets
    \-        Matches any character in range on either side of a dash
   *         Matches preceding pattern zero or more times
   +         Matches preceding pattern one or more times
   ?         Matches preceding pattern zero or once only
   |         Matches a pattern on either side of the |
   ()        Saves a matched subexpression, which can be referenced 
             in the REGEX REPLACE operation. Additionally it is saved
             by all regular expression\-related commands, including 
             e.g. if( MATCHES ), in the variables CMAKE_MATCH_(0..9).
.fi

.TP
.B target_link_libraries
Link a target to given libraries.

.nf
  target_link_libraries(<target> [item1 [item2 [...]]]
                        [[debug|optimized|general] <item>] ...)
.fi

Specify libraries or flags to use when linking a given target.  If a library name matches that of another target in the project a dependency will automatically be added in the build system to make sure the library being linked is up\-to\-date before the target links.  Item names starting with '\-', but not '\-l' or '\-framework', are treated as linker flags.


A "debug", "optimized", or "general" keyword indicates that the library immediately following it is to be used only for the corresponding build configuration.  The "debug" keyword corresponds to the Debug configuration (or to configurations named in the DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS global property if it is set).  The "optimized" keyword corresponds to all other configurations.  The "general" keyword corresponds to all configurations, and is purely optional (assumed if omitted).  Higher granularity may be achieved for per\-configuration rules by creating and linking to IMPORTED library targets.  See the IMPORTED mode of the add_library command for more information.  


Library dependencies are transitive by default.  When this target is linked into another target then the libraries linked to this target will appear on the link line for the other target too.  See the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES target property to override the set of transitive link dependencies for a target.


.nf
  target_link_libraries(<target> LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
                        [[debug|optimized|general] <lib>] ...)
.fi

The LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES mode appends the libraries to the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES and its per\-configuration equivalent target properties instead of using them for linking.  Libraries specified as "debug" are appended to the the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_DEBUG property (or to the properties corresponding to configurations listed in the DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS global property if it is set).  Libraries specified as "optimized" are appended to the the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property.  Libraries specified as "general" (or without any keyword) are treated as if specified for both "debug" and "optimized".


The library dependency graph is normally acyclic (a DAG), but in the case of mutually\-dependent STATIC libraries CMake allows the graph to contain cycles (strongly connected components).  When another target links to one of the libraries CMake repeats the entire connected component.  For example, the code


.nf
  add_library(A STATIC a.c)
  add_library(B STATIC b.c)
  target_link_libraries(A B)
  target_link_libraries(B A)
  add_executable(main main.c)
  target_link_libraries(main A)
.fi

links 'main' to 'A B A B'.  (While one repetition is usually sufficient, pathological object file and symbol arrangements can require more.  One may handle such cases by manually repeating the component in the last target_link_libraries call.  However, if two archives are really so interdependent they should probably be combined into a single archive.)

.TP
.B try_compile
Try compiling some code.

.nf
  try_compile(RESULT_VAR bindir srcdir
              projectName <targetname> [CMAKE_FLAGS <Flags>]
              [OUTPUT_VARIABLE var])
.fi

Try compiling a program.  In this form, srcdir should contain a complete CMake project with a CMakeLists.txt file and all sources. The bindir and srcdir will not be deleted after this command is run. If <target name> is specified then build just that target otherwise the all or ALL_BUILD target is built.


.nf
  try_compile(RESULT_VAR bindir srcfile
              [CMAKE_FLAGS <Flags>]
              [COMPILE_DEFINITIONS <flags> ...]
              [OUTPUT_VARIABLE var]
              [COPY_FILE <filename> )
.fi

Try compiling a srcfile.  In this case, the user need only supply a source file.  CMake will create the appropriate CMakeLists.txt file to build the source. If COPY_FILE is used, the compiled file will be copied to the given file.


In this version all files in bindir/CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp, will be cleaned automatically, for debugging a \-\-debug\-trycompile can be passed to cmake to avoid the clean. Some extra flags that  can be included are,  INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, LINK_DIRECTORIES, and LINK_LIBRARIES.  COMPILE_DEFINITIONS are \-Ddefinition that will be passed to the compile line.  try_compile creates a CMakeList.txt file on the fly that looks like this:


.nf
  add_definitions( <expanded COMPILE_DEFINITIONS from calling cmake>)
  include_directories(${INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES})
  link_directories(${LINK_DIRECTORIES})
  add_executable(cmTryCompileExec sources)
  target_link_libraries(cmTryCompileExec ${LINK_LIBRARIES})
.fi

In both versions of the command, if OUTPUT_VARIABLE is specified, then the output from the build process is stored in the given variable. Return the success or failure in RESULT_VAR. CMAKE_FLAGS can be used to pass \-DVAR:TYPE=VALUE flags to the cmake that is run during the build. 

.TP
.B try_run
Try compiling and then running some code.

.nf
  try_run(RUN_RESULT_VAR COMPILE_RESULT_VAR
          bindir srcfile [CMAKE_FLAGS <Flags>]
          [COMPILE_DEFINITIONS <flags>]
          [COMPILE_OUTPUT_VARIABLE comp]
          [RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE run]
          [OUTPUT_VARIABLE var]
          [ARGS <arg1> <arg2>...])
.fi

Try compiling a srcfile.  Return TRUE or FALSE for success or failure in COMPILE_RESULT_VAR.  Then if the compile succeeded, run the executable and return its exit code in RUN_RESULT_VAR. If the executable was built, but failed to run, then RUN_RESULT_VAR will be set to FAILED_TO_RUN. COMPILE_OUTPUT_VARIABLE specifies the variable where the output from the compile step goes. RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE specifies the variable where the output from the running executable goes.


For compatibility reasons OUTPUT_VARIABLE is still supported, which gives you the output from the compile and run step combined.


Cross compiling issues


When cross compiling, the executable compiled in the first step usually cannot be run on the build host. try_run() checks the CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING variable to detect whether CMake is in crosscompiling mode. If that's the case, it will still try to compile the executable, but it will not try to run the executable. Instead it will create cache variables which must be filled by the user or by presetting them in some CMake script file to the values the executable would have produced if it would have been run on its actual target platform. These variables are RUN_RESULT_VAR (explanation see above) and if RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE (or OUTPUT_VARIABLE) was used, an additional cache variable RUN_RESULT_VAR__COMPILE_RESULT_VAR__TRYRUN_OUTPUT.This is intended to hold stdout and stderr from the executable.


In order to make cross compiling your project easier, use try_run only if really required. If you use try_run, use RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE (or OUTPUT_VARIABLE) only if really required. Using them will require that when crosscompiling, the cache variables will have to be set manually to the output of the executable. You can also "guard" the calls to try_run with if(CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING) and provide an easy\-to\-preset alternative for this case.


.TP
.B unset
Unset a variable, cache variable, or environment variable.

.nf
  unset(<variable> [CACHE])
.fi

Removes the specified variable causing it to become undefined.  If CACHE is present then the variable is removed from the cache instead of the current scope.


<variable> can be an environment variable such as:


.nf
  unset(ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH})
.fi

in which case the variable will be removed from the current environment.

.TP
.B variable_watch
Watch the CMake variable for change.

.nf
  variable_watch(<variable name> [<command to execute>])

.PP
This is the documentation for the properties supported by CMake. Properties can have different scopes. They can either be assigned to a source file, a directory, a target or globally to CMake. By modifying the values of properties the behaviour of the build system can be customized.

.SH PROPERTIES OF GLOBAL SCOPE
.TP
.B ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS
Allow duplicate custom targets to be created.

Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a project have globally unique logical names (see policy CMP0002).  This is necessary to generate meaningful project file names in Xcode and VS IDE generators.  It also allows the target names to be referenced unambiguously.


Makefile generators are capable of supporting duplicate custom target names.  For projects that care only about Makefile generators and do not wish to support Xcode or VS IDE generators, one may set this property to true to allow duplicate custom targets.  The property allows multiple add_custom_target command calls in different directories to specify the same target name.  However, setting this property will cause non\-Makefile generators to produce an error and refuse to generate the project.

.TP
.B DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS
Specify which configurations are for debugging.

The value must be a semi\-colon separated list of configuration names.  Currently this property is used only by the target_link_libraries command (see its documentation for details).  Additional uses may be defined in the future.  


This property must be set at the top level of the project and before the first target_link_libraries command invocation.  If any entry in the list does not match a valid configuration for the project the behavior is undefined.

.TP
.B DISABLED_FEATURES
List of features which are disabled during the CMake run.

List of features which are disabled during the CMake run. Be default it contains the names of all packages which were not found. This is determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables. Packages which are searched QUIET are not listed. A project can add its own features to this list.This property is used by the macros in FeatureSummary.cmake.

.TP
.B ENABLED_FEATURES
List of features which are enabled during the CMake run.

List of features which are enabled during the CMake run. Be default it contains the names of all packages which were found. This is determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables. Packages which are searched QUIET are not listed. A project can add its own features to this list.This property is used by the macros in FeatureSummary.cmake.

.TP
.B ENABLED_LANGUAGES
Read\-only property that contains the list of currently enabled languages

Set to list of currently enabled languages.

.TP
.B FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS
Whether FIND_LIBRARY should automatically search lib64 directories.

FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS is a boolean specifying whether the FIND_LIBRARY command should automatically search the lib64 variant of directories called lib in the search path when building 64\-bit binaries.

.TP
.B FIND_LIBRARY_USE_OPENBSD_VERSIONING
Whether FIND_LIBRARY should find OpenBSD\-style shared libraries.

This property is a boolean specifying whether the FIND_LIBRARY command should find shared libraries with OpenBSD\-style versioned extension: ".so.<major>.<minor>".  The property is set to true on OpenBSD and false on other platforms.

.TP
.B GLOBAL_DEPENDS_DEBUG_MODE
Enable global target dependency graph debug mode.

CMake automatically analyzes the global inter\-target dependency graph at the beginning of native build system generation.  This property causes it to display details of its analysis to stderr.

.TP
.B GLOBAL_DEPENDS_NO_CYCLES
Disallow global target dependency graph cycles.

CMake automatically analyzes the global inter\-target dependency graph at the beginning of native build system generation.  It reports an error if the dependency graph contains a cycle that does not consist of all STATIC library targets.  This property tells CMake to disallow all cycles completely, even among static libraries.

.TP
.B IN_TRY_COMPILE
Read\-only property that is true during a try\-compile configuration.

True when building a project inside a TRY_COMPILE or TRY_RUN command.

.TP
.B PACKAGES_FOUND
List of packages which were found during the CMake run.

List of packages which were found during the CMake run. Whether a package has been found is determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.

.TP
.B PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND
List of packages which were not found during the CMake run.

List of packages which were not found during the CMake run. Whether a package has been found is determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.

.TP
.B REPORT_UNDEFINED_PROPERTIES
If set, report any undefined properties to this file.

If this property is set to a filename then when CMake runs it will report any properties or variables that were accessed but not defined into the filename specified in this property.

.TP
.B RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
Specify a launcher for compile rules.

Makefile generators prefix compiler commands with the given launcher command line.  This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build problems with high granularity.  Non\-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.

.TP
.B RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
Specify a launcher for custom rules.

Makefile generators prefix custom commands with the given launcher command line.  This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build problems with high granularity.  Non\-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.

.TP
.B RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
Specify a launcher for link rules.

Makefile generators prefix link and archive commands with the given launcher command line.  This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build problems with high granularity.  Non\-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.

.TP
.B RULE_MESSAGES
Specify whether to report a message for each make rule.

This property specifies whether Makefile generators should add a progress message describing what each build rule does.  If the property is not set the default is ON.  Set the property to OFF to disable granular messages and report only as each target completes.  This is intended to allow scripted builds to avoid the build time cost of detailed reports.  If a CMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES cache entry exists its value initializes the value of this property.  Non\-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.

.TP
.B TARGET_ARCHIVES_MAY_BE_SHARED_LIBS
Set if shared libraries may be named like archives.

On AIX shared libraries may be named "lib<name>.a".  This property is set to true on such platforms.

.TP
.B TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS
Does the target platform support shared libraries.

TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS is a boolean specifying whether the target platform supports shared libraries. Basically all current general general purpose OS do so, the exception are usually embedded systems with no or special OSs.

.TP
.B __CMAKE_DELETE_CACHE_CHANGE_VARS_
Internal property

Used to detect compiler changes, Do not set.

.SH PROPERTIES ON DIRECTORIES
.TP
.B ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES
Additional files to clean during the make clean stage.

A list of files that will be cleaned as a part of the "make clean" stage. 

.TP
.B CACHE_VARIABLES
List of cache variables available in the current directory.

This read\-only property specifies the list of CMake cache variables currently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.

.TP
.B CLEAN_NO_CUSTOM
Should the output of custom commands be left.

If this is true then the outputs of custom commands for this directory will not be removed during the "make clean" stage. 

.TP
.B COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
Preprocessor definitions for compiling a directory's sources.

The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a semicolon\-separated list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax VAR or VAR=value.  Function\-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system (note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some values).  This property may be set on a per\-configuration basis using the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG> where <CONFIG> is an upper\-case name (ex. "COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG").  This property will be initialized in each directory by its value in the directory's parent.


CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported by the native build tool.  The VS6 IDE does not support definition values with spaces (but NMake does).


Dislaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping certain values.  CMake has work\-arounds for many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work\-around the problem by adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work\-around may break in a future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then report the limitation.

.TP
.B COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>
Per\-configuration preprocessor definitions in a directory.

This is the configuration\-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS.  This property will be initialized in each directory by its value in the directory's parent.


.TP
.B DEFINITIONS
For CMake 2.4 compatibility only.  Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS instead.

This read\-only property specifies the list of flags given so far to the add_definitions command.  It is intended for debugging purposes.  Use the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS instead.

.TP
.B EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
Exclude the directory from the all target of its parent.

A property on a directory that indicates if its targets are excluded from the default build target. If it is not, then with a Makefile for example typing make will cause the targets to be built. The same concept applies to the default build of other generators.

.TP
.B IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM
Specify #include line transforms for dependencies in a directory.

This property specifies rules to transform macro\-like #include lines during implicit dependency scanning of C and C++ source files.  The list of rules must be semicolon\-separated with each entry of the form "A_MACRO(%)=value\-with\-%" (the % must be literal).  During dependency scanning occurrences of A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be replaced by the value given with the macro argument substituted for '%'.  For example, the entry


.nf
  MYDIR(%)=<mydir/%>
.fi

will convert lines of the form


.nf
  #include MYDIR(myheader.h)
.fi

to


.nf
  #include <mydir/myheader.h>
.fi

allowing the dependency to be followed.


This property applies to sources in all targets within a directory.  The property value is initialized in each directory by its value in the directory's parent.

.TP
.B INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
List of preprocessor include file search directories.

This read\-only property specifies the list of directories given so far to the include_directories command.  It is intended for debugging purposes.

.TP
.B INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
Include file scanning regular expression.

This read\-only property specifies the regular expression used during dependency scanning to match include files that should be followed.  See the include_regular_expression command.

.TP
.B INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
Enable interprocedural optimization for targets in a directory.

If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are known to be supported by the compiler.

.TP
.B INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>
Per\-configuration interprocedural optimization for a directory.

This is a per\-configuration version of INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION.  If set, this property overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

.TP
.B LINK_DIRECTORIES
List of linker search directories.

This read\-only property specifies the list of directories given so far to the link_directories command.  It is intended for debugging purposes.

.TP
.B LISTFILE_STACK
The current stack of listfiles being processed.

This property is mainly useful when trying to debug errors in your CMake scripts. It returns a list of what list files are currently being processed, in order. So if one listfile does an INCLUDE command then that is effectively pushing the included listfile onto the stack.

.TP
.B MACROS
List of macro commands available in the current directory.

This read\-only property specifies the list of CMake macros currently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.  See the macro command.

.TP
.B PARENT_DIRECTORY
Source directory that added current subdirectory.

This read\-only property specifies the source directory that added the current source directory as a subdirectory of the build.  In the top\-level directory the value is the empty\-string.

.TP
.B RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
Specify a launcher for compile rules.

See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides the global property for a directory.

.TP
.B RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
Specify a launcher for custom rules.

See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides the global property for a directory.

.TP
.B RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
Specify a launcher for link rules.

See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides the global property for a directory.

.TP
.B TEST_INCLUDE_FILE
A cmake file that will be included when ctest is run.

If you specify TEST_INCLUDE_FILE, that file will be included and processed when ctest is run on the directory.

.TP
.B VARIABLES
List of variables defined in the current directory.

This read\-only property specifies the list of CMake variables currently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.

.SH PROPERTIES ON TARGETS
.TP
.B <CONFIG>_OUTPUT_NAME
Old per\-configuration target file base name.

This is a configuration\-specific version of OUTPUT_NAME.  Use OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG> instead.

.TP
.B <CONFIG>_POSTFIX
Postfix to append to the target file name for configuration <CONFIG>.

When building with configuration <CONFIG> the value of this property is appended to the target file name built on disk.  For non\-executable targets, this property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX if it is set when a target is created.  This property is ignored on the Mac for Frameworks and App Bundles.

.TP
.B ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
Output directory in which to build ARCHIVE target files.

This property specifies the directory into which archive target files should be built. There are three kinds of target files that may be built: archive, library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For non\-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated as an archive target. All Windows\-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.  This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is created.

.TP
.B ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME
Output name for ARCHIVE target files.

This property specifies the base name for archive target files. It overrides OUTPUT_NAME and OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG> properties.  There are three kinds of target files that may be built: archive, library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For non\-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated as an archive target. All Windows\-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.

.TP
.B ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>
Per\-configuration output name for ARCHIVE target files.

This is the configuration\-specific version of ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME.

.TP
.B BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
Should build tree targets have install tree rpaths.

BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to link the target in the build tree with the INSTALL_RPATH.  This takes precedence over SKIP_BUILD_RPATH and avoids the need for relinking before installation.  This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH if it is set when a target is created.

.TP
.B COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
Preprocessor definitions for compiling a target's sources.

The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a semicolon\-separated list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax VAR or VAR=value.  Function\-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system (note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some values).  This property may be set on a per\-configuration basis using the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG> where <CONFIG> is an upper\-case name (ex. "COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG").


CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported by the native build tool.  The VS6 IDE does not support definition values with spaces (but NMake does).


Dislaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping certain values.  CMake has work\-arounds for many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work\-around the problem by adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work\-around may break in a future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then report the limitation.

.TP
.B COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>
Per\-configuration preprocessor definitions on a target.

This is the configuration\-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS.

.TP
.B COMPILE_FLAGS
Additional flags to use when compiling this target's sources.

The COMPILE_FLAGS property sets additional compiler flags used to build sources within the target.  Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to pass additional preprocessor definitions.

.TP
.B DEBUG_POSTFIX
See target property <CONFIG>_POSTFIX.

This property is a special case of the more\-general <CONFIG>_POSTFIX property for the DEBUG configuration.

.TP
.B DEFINE_SYMBOL
Define a symbol when compiling this target's sources.

DEFINE_SYMBOL sets the name of the preprocessor symbol defined when compiling sources in a shared library. If not set here then it is set to target_EXPORTS by default (with some substitutions if the target is not a valid C identifier). This is useful for headers to know whether they are being included from inside their library our outside to properly setup dllexport/dllimport decorations. 

.TP
.B ENABLE_EXPORTS
Specify whether an executable exports symbols for loadable modules.

Normally an executable does not export any symbols because it is the final program.  It is possible for an executable to export symbols to be used by loadable modules.  When this property is set to true CMake will allow other targets to "link" to the executable with the TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES command.  On all platforms a target\-level dependency on the executable is created for targets that link to it.  For non\-DLL platforms the link rule is simply ignored since the dynamic loader will automatically bind symbols when the module is loaded.  For DLL platforms an import library will be created for the exported symbols and then used for linking.  All Windows\-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.

.TP
.B EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
Exclude the target from the all target.

A property on a target that indicates if the target is excluded from the default build target. If it is not, then with a Makefile for example typing make will cause this target to be built. The same concept applies to the default build of other generators. Installing a target with EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set to true has undefined behavior.

.TP
.B EchoString
A message to be displayed when the target is built.

A message to display on some generators (such as makefiles) when the target is built.

.TP
.B FRAMEWORK
This target is a framework on the Mac.

If a shared library target has this property set to true it will be built as a framework when built on the mac. It will have the directory structure required for a framework and will be suitable to be used with the \-framework option

.TP
.B Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
Specify output directory for Fortran modules provided by the target.

If the target contains Fortran source files that provide modules and the compiler supports a module output directory this specifies the directory in which the modules will be placed.  When this property is not set the modules will be placed in the build directory corresponding to the target's source directory.  If the variable CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY is set when a target is created its value is used to initialize this property.

.TP
.B GENERATOR_FILE_NAME
Generator's file for this target.

An internal property used by some generators to record the name of project or dsp file associated with this target.

.TP
.B HAS_CXX
Link the target using the C++ linker tool (obselete).

This is equivalent to setting the LINKER_LANGUAGE property to CXX.  See that property's documentation for details.

.TP
.B IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM
Specify #include line transforms for dependencies in a target.

This property specifies rules to transform macro\-like #include lines during implicit dependency scanning of C and C++ source files.  The list of rules must be semicolon\-separated with each entry of the form "A_MACRO(%)=value\-with\-%" (the % must be literal).  During dependency scanning occurrences of A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be replaced by the value given with the macro argument substituted for '%'.  For example, the entry


.nf
  MYDIR(%)=<mydir/%>
.fi

will convert lines of the form


.nf
  #include MYDIR(myheader.h)
.fi

to


.nf
  #include <mydir/myheader.h>
.fi

allowing the dependency to be followed.


This property applies to sources in the target on which it is set.

.TP
.B IMPORTED
Read\-only indication of whether a target is IMPORTED.

The boolean value of this property is true for targets created with the IMPORTED option to add_executable or add_library.  It is false for targets built within the project.

.TP
.B IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS
Configurations provided for an IMPORTED target.

Lists configuration names available for an IMPORTED target.  The names correspond to configurations defined in the project from which the target is imported.  If the importing project uses a different set of configurations the names may be mapped using the MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG> property.  Ignored for non\-imported targets.

.TP
.B IMPORTED_IMPLIB
Full path to the import library for an IMPORTED target.

Specifies the location of the ".lib" part of a windows DLL.  Ignored for non\-imported targets.

.TP
.B IMPORTED_IMPLIB_<CONFIG>
Per\-configuration version of IMPORTED_IMPLIB property.

This property is used when loading settings for the <CONFIG> configuration of an imported target.  Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.

.TP
.B IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES
Dependent shared libraries of an imported shared library.

Shared libraries may be linked to other shared libraries as part of their implementation.  On some platforms the linker searches for the dependent libraries of shared libraries they are including in the link.  This property lists the dependent shared libraries of an imported library.  The list should be disjoint from the list of interface libraries in the IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property.  On platforms requiring dependent shared libraries to be found at link time CMake uses this list to add appropriate files or paths to the link command line.  Ignored for non\-imported targets.

.TP
.B IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
Per\-configuration version of IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES.

This property is used when loading settings for the <CONFIG> configuration of an imported target.  Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

.TP
.B IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES
Languages compiled into an IMPORTED static library.

Lists languages of soure files compiled to produce a STATIC IMPORTED library (such as "C" or "CXX").  CMake accounts for these languages when computing how to link a target to the imported library.  For example, when a C executable links to an imported C++ static library CMake chooses the C++ linker to satisfy language runtime dependencies of the static library.  


This property is ignored for targets that are not STATIC libraries.  This property is ignored for non\-imported targets.

.TP
.B IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES_<CONFIG>
Per\-configuration version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES.

This property is used when loading settings for the <CONFIG> configuration of an imported target.  Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

.TP
.B IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
Transitive link interface of an IMPORTED target.

Lists libraries whose interface is included when an IMPORTED library target is linked to another target.  The libraries will be included on the link line for the target.  Unlike the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES property, this property applies to all imported target types, including STATIC libraries.  This property is ignored for non\-imported targets.

.TP
.B IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
Per\-configuration version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.

This property is used when loading settings for the <CONFIG> configuration of an imported target.  Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

.TP
.B IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
Repetition count for cycles of IMPORTED static libraries.

This is LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY for IMPORTED targets.

.TP
.B IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_<CONFIG>
Per\-configuration repetition count for cycles of IMPORTED archives.

This is the configuration\-specific version of IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY.  If set, this property completely overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

.TP
.B IMPORTED_LOCATION
Full path to the main file on disk for an IMPORTED target.

Specifies the location of an IMPORTED target file on disk.  For executables this is the location of the executable file.  For bundles on OS X this is the location of the executable file inside Contents/MacOS under the application bundle folder.  For static libraries and modules this is the location of the library or module.  For shared libraries on non\-DLL platforms this is the location of the shared library.  For frameworks on OS X this is the location of the library file symlink just inside the framework folder.  For DLLs this is the location of the ".dll" part of the library.  For UNKNOWN libraries this is the location of the file to be linked.  Ignored for non\-imported targets.

.TP
.B IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>
Per\-configuration version of IMPORTED_LOCATION property.

This property is used when loading settings for the <CONFIG> configuration of an imported target.  Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.

.TP
.B IMPORTED_SONAME
The "soname" of an IMPORTED target of shared library type.

Specifies the "soname" embedded in an imported shared library.  This is meaningful only on platforms supporting the feature.  Ignored for non\-imported targets.

.TP
.B IMPORTED_SONAME_<CONFIG>
Per\-configuration version of IMPORTED_SONAME property.

This property is used when loading settings for the <CONFIG> configuration of an imported target.  Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from which the target is imported.

.TP
.B IMPORT_PREFIX
What comes before the import library name.

Similar to the target property PREFIX, but used for import libraries (typically corresponding to a DLL) instead of regular libraries. A target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as "lib") on an import library name.

.TP
.B IMPORT_SUFFIX
What comes after the import library name.

Similar to the target property SUFFIX, but used for import libraries (typically corresponding to a DLL) instead of regular libraries. A target property that can be set to override the suffix (such as ".lib") on an import library name.

.TP
.B INSTALL_NAME_DIR
Mac OSX directory name for installed targets.

INSTALL_NAME_DIR is a string specifying the directory portion of the "install_name" field of shared libraries on Mac OSX to use in the installed targets. 

.TP
.B INSTALL_RPATH
The rpath to use for installed targets.

A semicolon\-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed targets (for platforms that support it).  This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH if it is set when a target is created.

.TP
.B INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH
Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.

INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true will append directories in the linker search path and outside the project to the INSTALL_RPATH.  This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH if it is set when a target is created.

.TP
.B INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
Enable interprocedural optimization for a target.

If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are known to be supported by the compiler.

.TP
.B INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>
Per\-configuration interprocedural optimization for a target.

This is a per\-configuration version of INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION.  If set, this property overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

.TP
.B LABELS
Specify a list of text labels associated with a target.

Target label semantics are currently unspecified.

.TP
.B LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
Output directory in which to build LIBRARY target files.

This property specifies the directory into which library target files should be built. There are three kinds of target files that may be built: archive, library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For non\-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated as an archive target. All Windows\-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.  This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is created.

.TP
.B LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME
Output name for LIBRARY target files.

This property specifies the base name for library target files. It overrides OUTPUT_NAME and OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG> properties.  There are three kinds of target files that may be built: archive, library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For non\-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated as an archive target. All Windows\-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.

.TP
.B LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>
Per\-configuration output name for LIBRARY target files.

This is the configuration\-specific version of LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME.

.TP
.B LINKER_LANGUAGE
Specifies language whose compiler will invoke the linker.

For executables, shared libraries, and modules, this sets the language whose compiler is used to link the target (such as "C" or "CXX").  A typical value for an executable is the language of the source file providing the program entry point (main).  If not set, the language with the highest linker preference value is the default.  See documentation of CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE variables.

.TP
.B LINK_FLAGS
Additional flags to use when linking this target.

The LINK_FLAGS property can be used to add extra flags to the link step of a target. LINK_FLAGS_<CONFIG> will add to the configuration <CONFIG>, for example, DEBUG, RELEASE, MINSIZEREL, RELWITHDEBINFO. 

.TP
.B LINK_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
Per\-configuration linker flags for a target.

This is the configuration\-specific version of LINK_FLAGS.

.TP
.B LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
List public interface libraries for a shared library or executable.

By default linking to a shared library target transitively links to targets with which the library itself was linked.  For an executable with exports (see the ENABLE_EXPORTS property) no default transitive link dependencies are used.  This property replaces the default transitive link dependencies with an explict list.  When the target is linked into another target the libraries listed (and recursively their link interface libraries) will be provided to the other target also.  If the list is empty then no transitive link dependencies will be incorporated when this target is linked into another target even if the default set is non\-empty.  This property is ignored for STATIC libraries.

.TP
.B LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
Per\-configuration list of public interface libraries for a target.

This is the configuration\-specific version of LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES.  If set, this property completely overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

.TP
.B LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
Repetition count for STATIC libraries with cyclic dependencies.

When linking to a STATIC library target with cyclic dependencies the linker may need to scan more than once through the archives in the strongly connected component of the dependency graph.  CMake by default constructs the link line so that the linker will scan through the component at least twice.  This property specifies the minimum number of scans if it is larger than the default.  CMake uses the largest value specified by any target in a component.

.TP
.B LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_<CONFIG>
Per\-configuration repetition count for cycles of STATIC libraries.

This is the configuration\-specific version of LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY.  If set, this property completely overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

.TP
.B LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC
End a link line such that static system libraries are used.

Some linkers support switches such as \-Bstatic and \-Bdynamic to determine whether to use static or shared libraries for \-lXXX options.  CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for the platform.  By default the linker search type is left at \-Bdynamic by the end of the library list.  This property switches the final linker search type to \-Bstatic.

.TP
.B LOCATION
Read\-only location of a target on disk.

For an imported target, this read\-only property returns the value of the LOCATION_<CONFIG> property for an unspecified configuration <CONFIG> provided by the target.


For a non\-imported target, this property is provided for compatibility with CMake 2.4 and below.  It was meant to get the location of an executable target's output file for use in add_custom_command.  The path may contain a build\-system\-specific portion that is replaced at build time with the configuration getting built (such as "$(ConfigurationName)" in VS). In CMake 2.6 and above add_custom_command automatically recognizes a target name in its COMMAND and DEPENDS options and computes the target location.  Therefore this property is not needed for creating custom commands.

.TP
.B LOCATION_<CONFIG>
Read\-only property providing a target location on disk.

A read\-only property that indicates where a target's main file is located on disk for the configuration <CONFIG>.  The property is defined only for library and executable targets.  An imported target may provide a set of configurations different from that of the importing project.  By default CMake looks for an exact\-match but otherwise uses an arbitrary available configuration.  Use the MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG> property to map imported configurations explicitly.

.TP
.B MACOSX_BUNDLE
Build an executable as an application bundle on Mac OS X.

When this property is set to true the executable when built on Mac OS X will be created as an application bundle.  This makes it a GUI executable that can be launched from the Finder.  See the MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST target property for information about creation of the Info.plist file for the application bundle.

.TP
.B MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST
Specify a custom Info.plist template for a Mac OS X App Bundle.

An executable target with MACOSX_BUNDLE enabled will be built as an application bundle on Mac OS X.  By default its Info.plist file is created by configuring a template called MacOSXBundleInfo.plist.in located in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.  This property specifies an alternative template file name which may be a full path.


The following target properties may be set to specify content to be configured into the file:


.nf
  MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_STRING
  MACOSX_BUNDLE_ICON_FILE
  MACOSX_BUNDLE_GUI_IDENTIFIER
  MACOSX_BUNDLE_LONG_VERSION_STRING
  MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_NAME

CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all targets in a directory that do not have each specific property set.  If a custom Info.plist is specified by this property it may of course hard\-code all the settings instead of using the target properties.

.TP
.B MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST
Specify a custom Info.plist template for a Mac OS X Framework.

An library target with FRAMEWORK enabled will be built as a framework on Mac OS X.  By default its Info.plist file is created by configuring a template called MacOSXFrameworkInfo.plist.in located in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.  This property specifies an alternative template file name which may be a full path.


The following target properties may be set to specify content to be configured into the file:


.nf
  MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_ICON_FILE
  MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER
  MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_SHORT_VERSION_STRING
  MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_BUNDLE_VERSION
.fi

CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all targets in a directory that do not have each specific property set.  If a custom Info.plist is specified by this property it may of course hard\-code all the settings instead of using the target properties.

.TP
.B MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>
Map from project configuration to IMPORTED target's configuration.

List configurations of an imported target that may be used for the current project's <CONFIG> configuration.  Targets imported from another project may not provide the same set of configuration names available in the current project.  Setting this property tells CMake what imported configurations are suitable for use when building the <CONFIG> configuration.  The first configuration in the list found to be provided by the imported target is selected.  If no matching configurations are available the imported target is considered to be not found.  This property is ignored for non\-imported targets.

.TP
.B OUTPUT_NAME
Output name for target files.

This sets the base name for output files created for an executable or library target.  If not set, the logical target name is used by default.

.TP
.B OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>
Per\-configuration target file base name.

This is the configuration\-specific version of OUTPUT_NAME.

.TP
.B POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
Deprecated install support.

The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run before and after installing a target.  They are used only when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is used to install the target.  Use the INSTALL command instead.

.TP
.B PREFIX
What comes before the library name.

A target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as "lib") on a library name.

.TP
.B PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT
Deprecated install support.

The PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT and POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT properties are the old way to specify CMake scripts to run before and after installing a target.  They are used only when the old INSTALL_TARGETS command is used to install the target.  Use the INSTALL command instead.

.TP
.B PRIVATE_HEADER
Specify private header files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.

Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms.  This property may be set to a list of header files to be placed in the PrivateHeaders directory inside the framework folder.  On non\-Apple platforms these headers may be installed using the PRIVATE_HEADER option to the install(TARGETS) command.

.TP
.B PROJECT_LABEL
Change the name of a target in an IDE.

Can be used to change the name of the target in an IDE like visual stuido. 

.TP
.B PUBLIC_HEADER
Specify public header files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.

Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms.  This property may be set to a list of header files to be placed in the Headers directory inside the framework folder.  On non\-Apple platforms these headers may be installed using the PUBLIC_HEADER option to the install(TARGETS) command.

.TP
.B RESOURCE
Specify resource files in a FRAMEWORK shared library target.

Shared library targets marked with the FRAMEWORK property generate frameworks on OS X and normal shared libraries on other platforms.  This property may be set to a list of files to be placed in the Resources directory inside the framework folder.  On non\-Apple platforms these files may be installed using the RESOURCE option to the install(TARGETS) command.

.TP
.B RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
Specify a launcher for compile rules.

See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides the global and directory property for a target.

.TP
.B RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
Specify a launcher for custom rules.

See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides the global and directory property for a target.

.TP
.B RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
Specify a launcher for link rules.

See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides the global and directory property for a target.

.TP
.B RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
Output directory in which to build RUNTIME target files.

This property specifies the directory into which runtime target files should be built. There are three kinds of target files that may be built: archive, library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For non\-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated as an archive target. All Windows\-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.  This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is created.

.TP
.B RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME
Output name for RUNTIME target files.

This property specifies the base name for runtime target files.  It overrides OUTPUT_NAME and OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG> properties.  There are three kinds of target files that may be built: archive, library, and runtime.  Executables are always treated as runtime targets. Static libraries are always treated as archive targets. Module libraries are always treated as library targets. For non\-DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as library targets. For DLL platforms the DLL part of a shared library is treated as a runtime target and the corresponding import library is treated as an archive target. All Windows\-based systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.

.TP
.B RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>
Per\-configuration output name for RUNTIME target files.

This is the configuration\-specific version of RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME.

.TP
.B SKIP_BUILD_RPATH
Should rpaths be used for the build tree.

SKIP_BUILD_RPATH is a boolean specifying whether to skip automatic generation of an rpath allowing the target to run from the build tree.  This property is initialized by the value of the variable CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH if it is set when a target is created.

.TP
.B SOURCES
Source names specified for a target.

Read\-only list of sources specified for a target.  The names returned are suitable for passing to the set_source_files_properties command.

.TP
.B SOVERSION
What version number is this target.

For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to specify the build version and api version respectively. When building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports symlinks and the linker supports so\-names. If only one of both is specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number. For shared libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION attribute is parsed to extract a "major.minor" version number. These numbers are used as the image version of the binary. 

.TP
.B STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS
Extra flags to use when linking static libraries.

Extra flags to use when linking a static library.

.TP
.B SUFFIX
What comes after the library name.

A target property that can be set to override the suffix (such as ".so") on a library name.

.TP
.B TYPE
The type of the target.

This read\-only property can be used to test the type of the given target. It will be one of STATIC_LIBRARY, MODULE_LIBRARY, SHARED_LIBRARY, EXECUTABLE or one of the internal target types.

.TP
.B VERSION
What version number is this target.

For shared libraries VERSION and SOVERSION can be used to specify the build version and api version respectively. When building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports symlinks and the linker supports so\-names. If only one of both is specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number. For executables VERSION can be used to specify the build version. When building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports symlinks. For shared libraries and executables on Windows the VERSION attribute is parsed to extract a "major.minor" version number. These numbers are used as the image version of the binary. 

.TP
.B VS_KEYWORD
Visual Studio project keyword.

Can be set to change the visual studio keyword, for example QT integration works better if this is set to Qt4VSv1.0. 

.TP
.B VS_SCC_LOCALPATH
Visual Studio Source Code Control Provider.

Can be set to change the visual studio source code control local path property.

.TP

Can be set to change the visual studio source code control project name property.

.TP
.B VS_SCC_PROVIDER
Visual Studio Source Code Control Provider.

Can be set to change the visual studio source code control provider property.

.TP
.B WIN32_EXECUTABLE
Build an executable with a WinMain entry point on windows.

When this property is set to true the executable when linked on Windows will be created with a WinMain() entry point instead of of just main().This makes it a GUI executable instead of a console application.  See the CMAKE_MFC_FLAG variable documentation to configure use of MFC for WinMain executables.

.TP
.B XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an-attribute>
Set Xcode target attributes directly.

Tell the Xcode generator to set '<an\-attribute>' to a given value in the generated Xcode project.  Ignored on other generators.

.SH PROPERTIES ON TESTS
.TP
.B ENVIRONMENT
Specify environment variables that should be defined for running a test.

If set to a list of environment variables and values of the form MYVAR=value those environment variables will be defined while running the test. The environment is restored to its previous state after the test is done.

.TP
.B FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
If the output matches this regular expression the test will fail.

If set, if the output matches one of specified regular expressions, the test will fail.For example: PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "[^a\-z]Error;ERROR;Failed"

.TP
.B LABELS
Specify a list of text labels associated with a test.

The list is reported in dashboard submissions.

.TP
.B MEASUREMENT
Specify a CDASH measurement and value to be reported for a test.

If set to a name then that name will be reported to CDASH as a named measurement with a value of 1. You may also specify a value by setting MEASUREMENT to "measurement=value".

.TP
.B PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
The output must match this regular expression for the test to pass.

If set, the test output will be checked against the specified regular expressions and at least one of the regular expressions has to match, otherwise the test will fail.

.TP
.B TIMEOUT
How many seconds to allow for this test.

This property if set will limit a test to not take more than the specified number of seconds to run. If it exceeds that the test process will be killed and ctest will move to the next test. This setting takes precedence over CTEST_TESTING_TIMEOUT.

.TP
.B WILL_FAIL
If set to true, this will invert the pass/fail flag of the test.

This property can be used for tests that are expected to fail and return a non zero return code.

.SH PROPERTIES ON SOURCE FILES
.TP
.B ABSTRACT
Is this source file an abstract class.

A property on a source file that indicates if the source file represents a class that is abstract. This only makes sense for languages that have a notion of an abstract class and it is only used by some tools that wrap classes into other languages.

.TP
.B COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
Preprocessor definitions for compiling a source file.

The COMPILE_DEFINITIONS property may be set to a semicolon\-separated list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax VAR or VAR=value.  Function\-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system (note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some values).  This property may be set on a per\-configuration basis using the name COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG> where <CONFIG> is an upper\-case name (ex. "COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG").


CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported by the native build tool.  The VS6 IDE does not support definition values with spaces (but NMake does).  Xcode does not support per\-configuration definitions on source files.


Dislaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping certain values.  CMake has work\-arounds for many cases but some values may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work\-around the problem by adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work\-around may break in a future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then report the limitation.

.TP
.B COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>
Per\-configuration preprocessor definitions on a source file.

This is the configuration\-specific version of COMPILE_DEFINITIONS.  Note that Xcode does not support per\-configuration source file flags so this property will be ignored by the Xcode generator.

.TP
.B COMPILE_FLAGS
Additional flags to be added when compiling this source file.

These flags will be added to the list of compile flags when this source file builds.  Use COMPILE_DEFINITIONS to pass additional preprocessor definitions.

.TP
.B EXTERNAL_OBJECT
If set to true then this is an object file.

If this property is set to true then the source file is really an object file and should not be compiled.  It will still be linked into the target though.

.TP
.B GENERATED
Is this source file generated as part of the build process.

If a source file is generated by the build process CMake will handle it differently in temrs of dependency checking etc. Otherwise having a non\-existent source file could create problems.

.TP
.B HEADER_FILE_ONLY
Is this source file only a header file.

A property on a source file that indicates if the source file is a header file with no associated implementation. This is set automatically based on the file extension and is used by CMake to determine is certain dependency information should be computed.

.TP
.B KEEP_EXTENSION
Make the output file have the same extension as the source file.

If this property is set then the file extension of the output file will be the same as that of the source file. Normally the output file extension is computed based on the language of the source file, for example .cxx will go to a .o extension.

.TP
.B LABELS
Specify a list of text labels associated with a source file.

This property has meaning only when the source file is listed in a target whose LABELS property is also set.  No other semantics are currently specified.

.TP
.B LANGUAGE
What programming language is the file.

A property that can be set to indicate what programming language the source file is. If it is not set the language is determined based on the file extension. Typical values are CXX C etc.

.TP
.B LOCATION
The full path to a source file.

A read only property on a SOURCE FILE that contains the full path to the source file.

.TP
.B MACOSX_PACKAGE_LOCATION
Place a source file inside a Mac OS X bundle or framework.

Executable targets with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set are built as Mac OS X application bundles on Apple platforms.  Shared library targets with the FRAMEWORK property set are built as Mac OS X frameworks on Apple platforms.  Source files listed in the target with this property set will be copied to a directory inside the bundle or framework content folder specified by the property value.  For bundles the content folder is "<name>.app/Contents".  For frameworks the content folder is "<name>.framework/Versions/<version>".  See the PUBLIC_HEADER, PRIVATE_HEADER, and RESOURCE target properties for specifying files meant for Headers, PrivateHeadres, or Resources directories.

.TP
.B OBJECT_DEPENDS
Additional files on which a compiled object file depends.

Specifies a semicolon\-separated list of full\-paths to files on which any object files compiled from this source file depend.  An object file will be recompiled if any of the named files is newer than it.


This property need not be used to specify the dependency of a source file on a generated header file that it includes.  Although the property was originally introduced for this purpose, it is no longer necessary.  If the generated header file is created by a custom command in the same target as the source file, the automatic dependency scanning process will recognize the dependency.  If the generated header file is created by another target, an inter\-target dependency should be created with the add_dependencies command (if one does not already exist due to linking relationships).

.TP
.B OBJECT_OUTPUTS
Additional outputs for a Makefile rule.

Additional outputs created by compilation of this source file. If any of these outputs is missing the object will be recompiled. This is supported only on Makefile generators and will be ignored on other generators.

.TP
.B SYMBOLIC
Is this just a name for a rule.

If SYMBOLIC (boolean) is set to true the build system will be informed that the source file is not actually created on disk but instead used as a symbolic name for a build rule.

.TP
.B WRAP_EXCLUDE
Exclude this source file from any code wrapping techniques.

Some packages can wrap source files into alternate languages to provide additional functionality. For example, C++ code can be wrapped into Java or Python etc using SWIG etc. If WRAP_EXCLUDE is set to true (1 etc) that indicates then this source file should not be wrapped.

.SH PROPERTIES ON CACHE ENTRIES
.TP
.B ADVANCED
True if entry should be hidden by default in GUIs.

This is a boolean value indicating whether the entry is considered interesting only for advanced configuration.  The mark_as_advanced() command modifies this property.

.TP
.B HELPSTRING
Help associated with entry in GUIs.

This string summarizes the purpose of an entry to help users set it through a CMake GUI.

.TP
.B MODIFIED
Internal management property.  Do not set or get.

This is an internal cache entry property managed by CMake to track interactive user modification of entries.  Ignore it.

.TP
.B STRINGS
Enumerate possible STRING entry values for GUI selection.

For cache entries with type STRING, this enumerates a set of values.  CMake GUIs may use this to provide a selection widget instead of a generic string entry field.  This is for convenience only.  CMake does not enforce that the value matches one of those listed.

.TP
.B TYPE
Widget type for entry in GUIs.

Cache entry values are always strings, but CMake GUIs present widgets to help users set values.  The GUIs use this property as a hint to determine the widget type.  Valid TYPE values are:


.nf
  BOOL          = Boolean ON/OFF value.
  PATH          = Path to a directory.
  FILEPATH      = Path to a file.
  STRING        = Generic string value.
  INTERNAL      = Do not present in GUI at all.
  STATIC        = Value managed by CMake, do not change.
  UNINITIALIZED = Type not yet specified.
.fi

Generally the TYPE of a cache entry should be set by the command which creates it (set, option, find_library, etc.).

.TP
.B VALUE
Value of a cache entry.

This property maps to the actual value of a cache entry.  Setting this property always sets the value without checking, so use with care.

.SH COMPATIBILITY COMMANDS
.PP
.nf
  CMake Compatibility Listfile Commands \- Obsolete commands supported by CMake for compatibility.
.fi

.PP
This is the documentation for now obsolete listfile commands from previous CMake versions, which are still supported for compatibility reasons. You should instead use the newer, faster and shinier new commands. ;\-)

.TP
.B build_name
Deprecated.  Use ${CMAKE_SYSTEM} and ${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER} instead.

.nf
  build_name(variable)
.fi

Sets the specified variable to a string representing the platform and compiler settings.  These values are now available through the CMAKE_SYSTEM and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER variables.

.TP
.B exec_program
Deprecated.  Use the execute_process() command instead.

Run an executable program during the processing of the CMakeList.txt file.


.nf
  exec_program(Executable [directory in which to run]
               [ARGS <arguments to executable>]
               [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>]
               [RETURN_VALUE <var>])
.fi

The executable is run in the optionally specified directory.  The executable can include arguments if it is double quoted, but it is better to use the optional ARGS argument to specify arguments to the program.   This is because cmake will then be able to escape spaces in the executable path.  An optional argument OUTPUT_VARIABLE specifies a variable in which to store the output. To capture the return value of the execution, provide a RETURN_VALUE. If OUTPUT_VARIABLE is specified, then no output will go to the stdout/stderr of the console running cmake.


.TP
.B export_library_dependencies
Deprecated.  Use INSTALL(EXPORT) or EXPORT command.

This command generates an old\-style library dependencies file.  Projects requiring CMake 2.6 or later should not use the command.  Use instead the install(EXPORT) command to help export targets from an installation tree and the export() command to export targets from a build tree.


The old\-style library dependencies file does not take into account per\-configuration names of libraries or the LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES target property.


.nf
  export_library_dependencies(<file> [APPEND])
.fi

Create a file named <file> that can be included into a CMake listfile with the INCLUDE command.  The file will contain a number of SET commands that will set all the variables needed for library dependency information.  This should be the last command in the top level CMakeLists.txt file of the project.  If the APPEND option is specified, the SET commands will be appended to the given file instead of replacing it.

.TP
.B install_files
Deprecated.  Use the install(FILES ) command instead.

This command has been superceded by the install command.  It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code.  The FILES form is directly replaced by the FILES form of the install command.  The regexp form can be expressed more clearly using the GLOB form of the file command.


.nf
  install_files(<dir> extension file file ...)
.fi

Create rules to install the listed files with the given extension into the given directory.  Only files existing in the current source tree or its corresponding location in the binary tree may be listed.  If a file specified already has an extension, that extension will be removed first.  This is useful for providing lists of source files such as foo.cxx when you want the corresponding foo.h to be installed. A typical extension is '.h'.


.nf
  install_files(<dir> regexp)
.fi

Any files in the current source directory that match the regular expression will be installed.


.nf
  install_files(<dir> FILES file file ...)
.fi

Any files listed after the FILES keyword will be installed explicitly from the names given.  Full paths are allowed in this form.


The directory <dir> is relative to the installation prefix, which is stored in the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.

.TP
.B install_programs
Deprecated. Use the install(PROGRAMS ) command instead.

This command has been superceded by the install command.  It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code.  The FILES form is directly replaced by the PROGRAMS form of the INSTALL command.  The regexp form can be expressed more clearly using the GLOB form of the FILE command.


.nf
  install_programs(<dir> file1 file2 [file3 ...])
  install_programs(<dir> FILES file1 [file2 ...])
.fi

Create rules to install the listed programs into the given directory. Use the FILES argument to guarantee that the file list version of the command will be used even when there is only one argument.


.nf
  install_programs(<dir> regexp)
.fi

In the second form any program in the current source directory that matches the regular expression will be installed.


This command is intended to install programs that are not built by cmake, such as shell scripts.  See the TARGETS form of the INSTALL command to create installation rules for targets built by cmake.


The directory <dir> is relative to the installation prefix, which is stored in the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.

.TP
.B install_targets
Deprecated. Use the install(TARGETS )  command instead.

This command has been superceded by the install command.  It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code.


.nf
  install_targets(<dir> [RUNTIME_DIRECTORY dir] target target)
.fi

Create rules to install the listed targets into the given directory.  The directory <dir> is relative to the installation prefix, which is stored in the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. If RUNTIME_DIRECTORY is specified, then on systems with special runtime files (Windows DLL), the files will be copied to that directory.

.TP
.B link_libraries
Deprecated. Use the target_link_libraries() command instead.

Link libraries to all targets added later.


.nf
  link_libraries(library1 <debug | optimized> library2 ...)
.fi

Specify a list of libraries to be linked into any following targets (typically added with the add_executable or add_library calls).  This command is passed down to all subdirectories.  The debug and optimized strings may be used to indicate that the next library listed is to be used only for that specific type of build.

.TP
.B make_directory
Deprecated. Use the file(MAKE_DIRECTORY ) command instead.

.nf
  make_directory(directory)
.fi

Creates the specified directory.  Full paths should be given.  Any parent directories that do not exist will also be created.  Use with care.

.TP
.B remove
Deprecated. Use the list(REMOVE_ITEM ) command instead.

.nf
  remove(VAR VALUE VALUE ...)
.fi

Removes VALUE from the variable VAR.  This is typically used to remove entries from a vector (e.g. semicolon separated list).  VALUE is expanded.

.TP
.B subdir_depends
Deprecated.  Does nothing.

.nf
  subdir_depends(subdir dep1 dep2 ...)
.fi

Does not do anything.  This command used to help projects order parallel builds correctly.  This functionality is now automatic.

.TP
.B subdirs
Deprecated. Use the add_subdirectory() command instead.

Add a list of subdirectories to the build.


.nf
  subdirs(dir1 dir2 ...[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL exclude_dir1 exclude_dir2 ...]
          [PREORDER] )
.fi

Add a list of subdirectories to the build. The add_subdirectory command should be used instead of subdirs although subdirs will still work. This will cause any CMakeLists.txt files in the sub directories to be processed by CMake.  Any directories after the PREORDER flag are traversed first by makefile builds, the PREORDER flag has no effect on IDE projects.  Any directories after the EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL marker will not be included in the top level makefile or project file. This is useful for having CMake create makefiles or projects for a set of examples in a project. You would want CMake to generate makefiles or project files for all the examples at the same time, but you would not want them to show up in the top level project or be built each time make is run from the top.

.TP
.B use_mangled_mesa
Copy mesa headers for use in combination with system GL.

.nf
  use_mangled_mesa(PATH_TO_MESA OUTPUT_DIRECTORY)
.fi

The path to mesa includes, should contain gl_mangle.h.  The mesa headers are copied to the specified output directory.  This allows mangled mesa headers to override other GL headers by being added to the include directory path earlier.

.TP
.B utility_source
Specify the source tree of a third\-party utility.

.nf
  utility_source(cache_entry executable_name
                 path_to_source [file1 file2 ...])
.fi

When a third\-party utility's source is included in the distribution, this command specifies its location and name.  The cache entry will not be set unless the path_to_source and all listed files exist.  It is assumed that the source tree of the utility will have been built before it is needed.


When cross compiling CMake will print a warning if a utility_source() command is executed, because in many cases it is used to build an executable which is executed later on. This doesn't work when cross compiling, since the executable can run only on their target platform. So in this case the cache entry has to be adjusted manually so it points to an executable which is runnable on the build host.

.TP
.B variable_requires
Deprecated. Use the if() command instead.

Assert satisfaction of an option's required variables.


.nf
  variable_requires(TEST_VARIABLE RESULT_VARIABLE
                    REQUIRED_VARIABLE1
                    REQUIRED_VARIABLE2 ...)
.fi

The first argument (TEST_VARIABLE) is the name of the variable to be tested, if that variable is false nothing else is done. If TEST_VARIABLE is true, then the next argument (RESULT_VARIABLE) is a variable that is set to true if all the required variables are set. The rest of the arguments are variables that must be true or not set to NOTFOUND to avoid an error.  If any are not true, an error is reported.

.TP
.B write_file
Deprecated. Use the file(WRITE ) command instead.

.nf
  write_file(filename "message to write"... [APPEND])
.fi

The first argument is the file name, the rest of the arguments are messages to write. If the argument APPEND is specified, then the message will be appended.


NOTE 1: file(WRITE ... and file(APPEND ... do exactly the same as this one but add some more functionality.


NOTE 2: When using write_file the produced file cannot be used as an input to CMake (CONFIGURE_FILE, source file ...) because it will lead to an infinite loop. Use configure_file if you want to generate input files to CMake.

.SH MODULES

.B BundleUtilities
.nf
 
.fi

BundleUtilities.cmake


A collection of CMake utility functions useful for dealing with .app bundles on the Mac and bundle\-like directories on any OS.


The following functions are provided by this script:


.nf
   get_bundle_main_executable
   get_dotapp_dir
   get_bundle_and_executable
   get_bundle_all_executables
   get_item_key
   clear_bundle_keys
   set_bundle_key_values
   get_bundle_keys
   copy_resolved_item_into_bundle
   fixup_bundle_item
   fixup_bundle
   copy_and_fixup_bundle
   verify_bundle_prerequisites
   verify_bundle_symlinks
   verify_app
.fi




Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function, break and PARENT_SCOPE. Also depends on GetPrerequisites.cmake.

.TP
.B CMakeBackwardCompatibilityCXX
define a bunch of backwards compatibility variables

.nf
  CMAKE_ANSI_CXXFLAGS \- flag for ansi c++ 
  CMAKE_HAS_ANSI_STRING_STREAM \- has <strstream>
  INCLUDE(TestForANSIStreamHeaders)
  INCLUDE(CheckIncludeFileCXX)
  INCLUDE(TestForSTDNamespace)
  INCLUDE(TestForANSIForScope)
.fi

.TP
.B CMakeDependentOption
Macro to provide an option dependent on other options.

This macro presents an option to the user only if a set of other conditions are true.  When the option is not presented a default value is used, but any value set by the user is preserved for when the option is presented again. Example invocation:


.nf
  CMAKE_DEPENDENT_OPTION(USE_FOO "Use Foo" ON
                         "USE_BAR;NOT USE_ZOT" OFF)
.fi

If USE_BAR is true and USE_ZOT is false, this provides an option called USE_FOO that defaults to ON.  Otherwise, it sets USE_FOO to OFF.  If the status of USE_BAR or USE_ZOT ever changes, any value for the USE_FOO option is saved so that when the option is re\-enabled it retains its old value.

.TP
.B CMakeDetermineVSServicePack
Includes a public function for assisting users in trying to determine the

Visual Studio service pack in use.


Sets the passed in variable to one of the following values or an empty string if unknown.


.nf
    vc80
    vc80sp1
    vc90
    vc90sp1
.fi




Usage: ===========================


.nf
    if(MSVC)
       include(CMakeDetermineVSServicePack)
       DetermineVSServicePack( my_service_pack )
.fi




.nf
       if( my_service_pack )
           message(STATUS "Detected: ${my_service_pack}")
       endif()

.B CMakeFindFrameworks
helper module to find OSX frameworks

.TP
.B CMakeForceCompiler
.nf
 
.fi

This module defines macros intended for use by cross\-compiling toolchain files when CMake is not able to automatically detect the compiler identification.


Macro CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER has the following signature:


.nf
   CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER(<compiler> <compiler\-id>)
.fi

It sets CMAKE_C_COMPILER to the given compiler and the cmake internal variable CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID to the given compiler\-id. It also bypasses the check for working compiler and basic compiler information tests.


Macro CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER has the following signature:


.nf
   CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER(<compiler> <compiler\-id>)
.fi

It sets CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to the given compiler and the cmake internal variable CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID to the given compiler\-id. It also bypasses the check for working compiler and basic compiler information tests.


So a simple toolchain file could look like this:


.nf
   INCLUDE (CMakeForceCompiler)
   SET(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Generic)
   CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER   (chc12 MetrowerksHicross)
   CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER (chc12 MetrowerksHicross)
.fi

.TP
.B CMakePrintSystemInformation
print system information

This file can be used for diagnostic purposes just include it in a project to see various internal CMake variables.

.TP
.B CMakeVerifyManifest
.nf
 
.fi

CMakeVerifyManifest.cmake


This script is used to verify that embeded manifests and side by side manifests for a project match.  To run this script, cd to a directory and run the script with cmake \-P. On the command line you can pass in versions that are OK even if not found in the .manifest files. For example,  cmake \-Dallow_versions=8.0.50608.0 \-PCmakeVerifyManifest.cmake could be used to allow an embeded manifest of 8.0.50608.0 to be used in a project even if that version was not found in the .manifest file.

.TP
.B CPack
Build binary and source package installers




The CPack module generates binary and source installers in a variety of formats using the cpack program. Inclusion of the CPack module adds two new targets to the resulting makefiles, package and package_source, which build the binary and source installers, respectively. The generated binary installers contain everything installed via CMake's INSTALL command (and the deprecated INSTALL_FILES, INSTALL_PROGRAMS, and INSTALL_TARGETS commands).


For certain kinds of binary installers (including the graphical installers on Mac OS X and Windows), CPack generates installers that allow users to select individual application components to install. The contents of each of the components are identified by the COMPONENT argument of CMake's INSTALL command. These components can be annotated with user\-friendly names and descriptions, inter\-component dependencies, etc., and grouped in various ways to customize the resulting installer. See the cpack_add_* commands, described below, for more information about component\-specific installations.


Before including the CPack module, there are a variety of variables that can be set to customize the resulting installers. The most commonly\-used variables are:


.nf
   CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME \- The name of the package (or application). If
   not specified, defaults to the project name.
.fi

   generators.
.fi




.nf
   CPACK_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE \- The name of the CPack configuration file
   for binary installers that will be generated by the CPack
   module. Defaults to CPackConfig.cmake.
.fi




.nf
   CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES \- Lists each of the executables along
   with a text label, to be used to create Start Menu shortcuts on

   create a shortcut named "CMake" that will execute the installed
   executable ccmake.
.fi




.nf
   CPACK_STRIP_FILES \- List of files to be stripped. Starting with
   CMake 2.6.0 CPACK_STRIP_FILES will be a boolean variable which
   enables stripping of all files (a list of files evaluates to TRUE

   installers that download component son\-the\-fly for Mac OS X 10.5
   or newer. If left blank, this value will be set to the minimum
   version of Mac OS X that supports the requested features. Set this
   variable to some value (e.g., 10.4) only if you want to guarantee
   that your installer will work on that version of Mac OS X, and

.nf
   DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component, used in
   graphical installers to give the user additional information about
   the component. Descriptions can span multiple lines using "\\n" as
   the line separator. Typically, these descriptions should be no
   more than a few lines long.
.fi




.nf
   HIDDEN indicates that this component will be hidden in the
   graphical installer, so that the user cannot directly change
   whether it is installed or not.
.fi




.nf
   REQUIRED indicates that this component is required, and therefore
   will always be installed. It will be visible in the graphical
   installer, but it cannot be unselected. (Typically, required
   components are shown greyed out).
.fi




.nf
   DISABLED indicates that this component should be disabled
   (unselected) by default. The user is free to select this component
   for installation, unless it is also HIDDEN.
.fi




.nf
   DEPENDS lists the components on which this component depends. If
   this component is selected, then each of the components listed
   must also be selected. The dependency information is encoded
   within the installer itself, so that users cannot install
   inconsitent sets of components.
.fi




.nf
   GROUP names the component group of which this component is a
   part. If not provided, the component will be a standalone
   component, not part of any component group. Component groups are
   described with the cpack_add_component_group command, detailed
   below.
.fi




.nf
   INSTALL_TYPES lists the installation types of which this component
   is a part. When one of these installations types is selected, this
   component will automatically be selected. Installation types are
   described with the cpack_add_install_type command, detailed below.
.fi




.nf
   DOWNLOADED indicates that this component should be downloaded
   on\-the\-fly by the installer, rather than packaged in with the
   installer itself. For more information, see the cpack_configure_downloads
   command.
.fi




.nf
   ARCHIVE_FILE provides a name for the archive file created by CPack
   to be used for downloaded components. If not supplied, CPack will
   create a file with some name based on CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME and
   the name of the component. See cpack_configure_downloads for more
   information.
.fi




.nf
   cpack_add_component_group \- Describes a group of related CPack
   installation components.

.fi




.nf
   The cpack_add_component_group describes a group of installation
   components, which will be placed together within the listing of
   options. Typically, component groups allow the user to
   select/deselect all of the components within a single group via a
   single group\-level option. Use component groups to reduce the
   complexity of installers with many options. groupname is an
   arbitrary name used to identify the group in the GROUP argument of
   the cpack_add_component command, which is used to place a
   component in a group. The name of the group must not conflict with
   the name of any component.
.fi




.nf
   DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component group, used in
   graphical installers to display the component group name. This
   value can be any string.
.fi




.nf
   DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component group,
   used in graphical installers to give the user additional
   information about the components within that group. Descriptions
   can span multiple lines using "\\n" as the line
   separator. Typically, these descriptions should be no more than a
   few lines long.
.fi




.nf
   PARENT_GROUP, if supplied, names the parent group of this group. 
   Parent groups are used to establish a hierarchy of groups, 
   providing an arbitrary hierarchy of groups.
.fi




.nf
   EXPANDED indicates that, by default, the group should show up as
   "expanded", so that the user immediately sees all of the
   components within the group. Otherwise, the group will initially
   show up as a single entry.
.fi




.nf
   BOLD_TITLE indicates that the group title should appear in bold,
   to call the user's attention to the group.
.fi




.nf
   cpack_add_install_type \- Add a new installation type containing a
   set of predefined component selections to the graphical installer.
                      
     cpack_add_install_type(typename
                            [DISPLAY_NAME name])   
.fi




.nf
   The cpack_add_install_type command identifies a set of preselected
   components that represents a common use case for an
   application. For example, a "Developer" install type might include
   an application along with its header and library files, while an
   "End user" install type might just include the application's
   executable. Each component identifies itself with one or more
   install types via the INSTALL_TYPES argument to
   cpack_add_component.
.fi




.nf
   DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the install type, which will
   typically show up in a drop\-down box within a graphical
   installer. This value can be any string.
.fi




.nf
   cpack_configure_downloads \- Configure CPack to download selected
   components on\-the\-fly as part of the installation process.
.fi

                               [ADD_REMOVE|NO_ADD_REMOVE])
.fi




.nf
   The cpack_configure_downloads command configures installation\-time
   downloads of selected components. For each downloadable component,
   CPack will create an archive containing the contents of that
   component, which should be uploaded to the given site. When the
   user selects that component for installation, the installer will
   download and extract the component in place. This feature is
   useful for creating small installers that only download the
   requested components, saving bandwidth. Additionally, the
   installers are small enough that they will be installed as part of
   the normal installation process, and the "Change" button in
   Windows Add/Remove Programs control panel will allow one to add or
   remove parts of the application after the original
   installation. On Windows, the downloaded\-components functionality
   requires the ZipDLL plug\-in for NSIS, available at:

    )
.fi

The *_DIR options specify directories for the project, with default directories computed as follows. If the PREFIX option is given to ExternalProject_Add() or the EP_PREFIX directory property is set, then an external project is built and installed under the specified prefix:


.nf
   TMP_DIR      = <prefix>/tmp
   STAMP_DIR    = <prefix>/src/<name>\-stamp
   DOWNLOAD_DIR = <prefix>/src
   SOURCE_DIR   = <prefix>/src/<name>
   BINARY_DIR   = <prefix>/src/<name>\-build
   INSTALL_DIR  = <prefix>
.fi

Otherwise, if the EP_BASE directory property is set then components of an external project are stored under the specified base:


.nf
   TMP_DIR      = <base>/tmp/<name>
   STAMP_DIR    = <base>/Stamp/<name>
   DOWNLOAD_DIR = <base>/Download/<name>
   SOURCE_DIR   = <base>/Source/<name>
   BINARY_DIR   = <base>/Build/<name>
   INSTALL_DIR  = <base>/Install/<name>
.fi

If no PREFIX, EP_PREFIX, or EP_BASE is specified then the default is to set PREFIX to "<name>\-prefix". Relative paths are interpreted with respect to the build directory corresponding to the source directory in which ExternalProject_Add is invoked.


If SOURCE_DIR is explicitly set to an existing directory the project will be built from it. Otherwise a download step must be specified using one of the DOWNLOAD_COMMAND, CVS_*, SVN_*, or URL options. The URL option may refer locally to a directory or source tarball, or refer to a remote tarball (e.g. http://.../src.tgz).


The 'ExternalProject_Add_Step' function adds a custom step to an external project:


.nf
  ExternalProject_Add_Step(<name> <step> # Names of project and custom step
    [COMMAND cmd...]        # Command line invoked by this step
    [COMMENT "text..."]     # Text printed when step executes
    [DEPENDEES steps...]    # Steps on which this step depends
    [DEPENDERS steps...]    # Steps that depend on this step
    [DEPENDS files...]      # Files on which this step depends
    [ALWAYS 1]              # No stamp file, step always runs
    [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir] # Working directory for command
    )
.fi

The command line, comment, and working directory of every standard and custom step is processed to replace tokens <SOURCE_DIR>, <BINARY_DIR>, <INSTALL_DIR>, and <TMP_DIR> with corresponding property values.


The 'ExternalProject_Get_Property' function retrieves external project target properties:


.nf
  ExternalProject_Get_Property(<name> [prop1 [prop2 [...]]])
.fi

It stores property values in variables of the same name. Property names correspond to the keyword argument names of 'ExternalProject_Add'.

This module sets the following variables:


.nf
  BLAS_FOUND \- set to true if a library implementing the BLAS interface
    is found
  BLAS_LINKER_FLAGS \- uncached list of required linker flags (excluding \-l
    and \-L).
  BLAS_LIBRARIES \- uncached list of libraries (using full path name) to
    link against to use BLAS
  BLAS95_LIBRARIES \- uncached list of libraries (using full path name)

.B FindBoost
Try to find Boost include dirs and libraries

Usage of this module as follows:


NOTE: Take note of the Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable below. Due to Boost naming conventions and limitations in CMake this find module is NOT future safe with respect to Boost version numbers, and may break.


== Using Header\-Only libraries from within Boost: ==


.nf
   find_package( Boost 1.36.0 )
   if(Boost_FOUND)
      include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
      add_executable(foo foo.cc)
   endif()
.fi







== Using actual libraries from within Boost: ==


.nf
   set(Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS   ON)
   set(Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED ON)
   find_package( Boost 1.36.0 COMPONENTS date_time filesystem system ... )
.fi




.nf
   if(Boost_FOUND)
      include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
      add_executable(foo foo.cc)
      target_link_libraries(foo ${Boost_LIBRARIES})
   endif()
.fi







The components list needs to contain actual names of boost libraries only, such as "date_time" for "libboost_date_time".  If you're using parts of Boost that contain header files only (e.g. foreach) you do not need to specify COMPONENTS.


You should provide a minimum version number that should be used. If you provide this  version number and specify the REQUIRED attribute, this module will fail if it can't find the specified or a later version. If you specify a version number this is automatically put into the considered list of version numbers and thus doesn't need to be specified in the Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable (see below).


NOTE for Visual Studio Users:


.nf
     Automatic linking is used on MSVC & Borland compilers by default when
     #including things in Boost.  It's important to note that setting
     Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS to OFF is NOT enough to get you dynamic linking,
     should you need this feature.  Automatic linking typically uses static
     libraries with a few exceptions (Boost.Python is one).
.fi




.nf
     Please see the section below near Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS for
     more details.  Adding a TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES() as shown in the example
     above appears to cause VS to link dynamically if Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS
     gets set to OFF.  It is suggested you avoid automatic linking since it
     will make your application less portable.
.fi




=========== The mess that is Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS (sorry?) ============


OK, so the Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable can be used to specify a list of boost version numbers that should be taken into account when searching for Boost. Unfortunately boost puts the version number into the actual filename for the libraries, so this variable will certainly be needed in the future when new Boost versions are released.


Currently this module searches for the following version numbers: 1.33, 1.33.0, 1.33.1, 1.34, 1.34.0, 1.34.1, 1.35, 1.35.0, 1.35.1, 1.36, 1.36.0, 1.36.1, 1.37, 1.37.0, 1.38, 1.38.0, 1.39, 1.39.0, 1.40, 1.40.0


NOTE: If you add a new major 1.x version in Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS you should add both 1.x and 1.x.0 as shown above.  Official Boost include directories omit the 3rd version number from include paths if it is 0 although not all binary Boost releases do so.


SET(Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS "1.78" "1.78.0" "1.79" "1.79.0")


===================================== ============= ========================


Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour and need to be set before calling find_package:


.nf
   Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED      Can be set to OFF to use the non\-multithreaded
                                boost libraries.  If not specified, defaults
                                to ON.
.fi




.nf
   Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS        Can be set to ON to force the use of the static
                                boost libraries. Defaults to OFF.

.fi




.nf
  BULLET_FOUND \- Was bullet found
  BULLET_INCLUDE_DIRS \- the Bullet include directories
  BULLET_LIBRARIES \- Link to this, by default it includes
                     all bullet components (Dynamics,
                     Collision, LinearMath, & SoftBody)

.B FindCABLE
Find CABLE

This module finds if CABLE is installed and determines where the include files and libraries are.  This code sets the following variables:


.nf
  CABLE             the path to the cable executable
  CABLE_TCL_LIBRARY the path to the Tcl wrapper library
  CABLE_INCLUDE_DIR the path to the include directory
.fi




To build Tcl wrappers, you should add shared library and link it to ${CABLE_TCL_LIBRARY}.  You should also add ${CABLE_INCLUDE_DIR} as an include directory.

.TP
.B FindCUDA
Tools for building CUDA C files: libraries and build dependencies.

This script locates the NVIDIA CUDA C tools. It should work on linux, windows, and mac and should be reasonably up to date with CUDA C releases.


This script makes use of the standard find_package arguments of <VERSION>, REQUIRED and QUIET.  CUDA_FOUND will report if an acceptable version of CUDA was found.


The script will prompt the user to specify CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR if the prefix cannot be determined by the location of nvcc in the system path and REQUIRED is specified to find_package(). To use a different installed version of the toolkit set the environment variable CUDA_BIN_PATH before running cmake (e.g. CUDA_BIN_PATH=/usr/local/cuda1.0 instead of the default /usr/local/cuda) or set CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR after configuring.  If you change the value of CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR, various components that depend on the path will be relocated.


It might be necessary to set CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR manually on certain platforms, or to use a cuda runtime not installed in the default location. In newer versions of the toolkit the cuda library is included with the graphics driver\- be sure that the driver version matches what is needed by the cuda runtime version.


The following variables affect the behavior of the macros in the script (in alphebetical order).  Note that any of these flags can be changed multiple times in the same directory before calling CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE, CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_COMPILE, CUDA_COMPILE_PTX or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS.


.nf
  CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE (Default matches host bit size)
  \-\- Set to ON to compile for 64 bit device code, OFF for 32 bit device code.
     Note that making this different from the host code when generating object
     or C files from CUDA code just won't work, because size_t gets defined by
     nvcc in the generated source.  If you compile to PTX and then load the
     file yourself, you can mix bit sizes between device and host.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE (Default ON)
  \-\- Set to ON if you want the custom build rule to be attached to the source
     file in Visual Studio.  Turn OFF if you add the same cuda file to multiple
     targets.
.fi




.nf
     This allows the user to build the target from the CUDA file; however, bad
     things can happen if the CUDA source file is added to multiple targets.
     When performing parallel builds it is possible for the custom build
     command to be run more than once and in parallel causing cryptic build
     errors.  VS runs the rules for every source file in the target, and a
     source can have only one rule no matter how many projects it is added to.
     When the rule is run from multiple targets race conditions can occur on
     the generated file.  Eventually everything will get built, but if the user
     is unaware of this behavior, there may be confusion.  It would be nice if
     this script could detect the reuse of source files across multiple targets
     and turn the option off for the user, but no good solution could be found.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_BUILD_CUBIN (Default OFF)
  \-\- Set to ON to enable and extra compilation pass with the \-cubin option in
     Device mode. The output is parsed and register, shared memory usage is
     printed during build.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION (Default OFF for device mode)
  \-\- Set to ON for Emulation mode. \-D_DEVICEEMU is defined for CUDA C files
     when CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION is TRUE.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_GENERATED_OUTPUT_DIR (Default CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR)
  \-\- Set to the path you wish to have the generated files placed.  If it is
     blank output files will be placed in CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR.
     Intermediate files will always be placed in
     CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR/CMakeFiles.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_HOST_COMPILATION_CPP (Default ON)
  \-\- Set to OFF for C compilation of host code.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS
  CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
  \-\- Additional NVCC command line arguments.  NOTE: multiple arguments must be
     semi\-colon delimited (e.g. \-\-compiler\-options;\-Wall)
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_PROPAGATE_HOST_FLAGS (Default ON)
  \-\- Set to ON to propagate CMAKE_{C,CXX}_FLAGS and their configuration
     dependent counterparts (e.g. CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG) automatically to the
     host compiler through nvcc's \-Xcompiler flag.  This helps make the
     generated host code match the rest of the system better.  Sometimes
     certain flags give nvcc problems, and this will help you turn the flag
     propagation off.  This does not affect the flags supplied directly to nvcc
     via CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS or through the OPTION flags specified through
     CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE, or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS.  Flags used for
     shared library compilation are not affected by this flag.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_VERBOSE_BUILD (Default OFF)
  \-\- Set to ON to see all the commands used when building the CUDA file.  When
     using a Makefile generator the value defaults to VERBOSE (run make
     VERBOSE=1 to see output), although setting CUDA_VERBOSE_BUILD to ON will
     always print the output.
.fi




The script creates the following macros (in alphebetical order):


.nf
  CUDA_ADD_CUFFT_TO_TARGET( cuda_target )
  \-\- Adds the cufft library to the target (can be any target).  Handles whether
     you are in emulation mode or not.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_ADD_CUBLAS_TO_TARGET( cuda_target )
  \-\- Adds the cublas library to the target (can be any target).  Handles
     whether you are in emulation mode or not.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE( cuda_target file0 file1 ...
                       [WIN32] [MACOSX_BUNDLE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [OPTIONS ...] )
  \-\- Creates an executable "cuda_target" which is made up of the files
     specified.  All of the non CUDA C files are compiled using the standard
     build rules specified by CMAKE and the cuda files are compiled to object
     files using nvcc and the host compiler.  In addition CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS is
     added automatically to include_directories().  Standard CMake target calls
     can be used on the target after calling this macro
     (e.g. set_target_properties and target_link_libraries).
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY( cuda_target file0 file1 ...
                    [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [OPTIONS ...] )
  \-\- Same as CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE except that a library is created.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_BUILD_CLEAN_TARGET()
  \-\- Creates a convience target that deletes all the dependency files

  CUDA_COMPILE( generated_files file0 file1 ... [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE]
                [OPTIONS ...] )

     with ADD_LIBRARY or ADD_EXECUTABLE.
.fi




.nf

  \-\- Returns a list of PTX files generated from the input source files.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES( path0 path1 ... )
  \-\- Sets the directories that should be passed to nvcc
     (e.g. nvcc \-Ipath0 \-Ipath1 ... ). These paths usually contain other .cu
     files.
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_WRAP_SRCS ( cuda_target format generated_files file0 file1 ...
                   [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE] [OPTIONS ...] )
  \-\- This is where all the magic happens.  CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE,
     CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_COMPILE, and CUDA_COMPILE_PTX all call this
     function under the hood.
.fi




.nf
     Given the list of files (file0 file1 ... fileN) this macro generates
     custom commands that generate either PTX or linkable objects (use "PTX" or
     "OBJ" for the format argument to switch).  Files that don't end with .cu
     or have the HEADER_FILE_ONLY property are ignored.
.fi




.nf
     The arguments passed in after OPTIONS are extra command line options to
     give to nvcc.  You can also specify per configuration options by
     specifying the name of the configuration followed by the options.  General
     options must preceed configuration specific options.  Not all
     configurations need to be specified, only the ones provided will be used.

     For certain configurations (namely VS generating object files with
     CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE set to ON), no generated file will
     be produced for the given cuda file.  This is because when you add the
     cuda file to Visual Studio it knows that this file produces an object file
     and will link in the resulting object file automatically.
.fi




.nf
     This script will also generate a separate cmake script that is used at
     build time to invoke nvcc.  This is for serveral reasons.
.fi




.nf
       1. nvcc can return negative numbers as return values which confuses
       Visual Studio into thinking that the command succeeded.  The script now
       checks the error codes and produces errors when there was a problem.
.fi




.nf
       2. nvcc has been known to not delete incomplete results when it
       encounters problems.  This confuses build systems into thinking the
       target was generated when in fact an unusable file exists.  The script
       now deletes the output files if there was an error.
.fi




.nf
       3. By putting all the options that affect the build into a file and then
       make the build rule dependent on the file, the output files will be
       regenerated when the options change.
.fi




.nf
     This script also looks at optional arguments STATIC, SHARED, or MODULE to
     determine when to target the object compilation for a shared library.
     BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is ignored in CUDA_WRAP_SRCS, but it is respected in
     CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY.  On some systems special flags are added for building
     objects intended for shared libraries.  A preprocessor macro,
     <target_name>_EXPORTS is defined when a shared library compilation is
     detected.
.fi




.nf
     Flags passed into add_definitions with \-D or /D are passed along to nvcc.
.fi




The script defines the following variables:


.nf
  CUDA_VERSION_MAJOR    \-\- The major version of cuda as reported by nvcc.
  CUDA_VERSION_MINOR    \-\- The minor version.
  CUDA_VERSION
  CUDA_VERSION_STRING   \-\- CUDA_VERSION_MAJOR.CUDA_VERSION_MINOR
.fi




.nf
  CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR \-\- Path to the CUDA Toolkit (defined if not set).
  CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR     \-\- Path to the CUDA SDK.  Use this to find files in the
                           SDK.  This script will not directly support finding
                           specific libraries or headers, as that isn't
                           supported by NVIDIA.  If you want to change
                           libraries when the path changes see the
                           FindCUDA.cmake script for an example of how to clear
                           these variables.  There are also examples of how to
                           use the CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR to locate headers or
                           libraries, if you so choose (at your own risk).
  CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS     \-\- Include directory for cuda headers.  Added automatically
                           for CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE and CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY.
  CUDA_LIBRARIES        \-\- Cuda RT library.
  CUDA_CUFFT_LIBRARIES  \-\- Device or emulation library for the Cuda FFT
                           implementation (alternative to:
                           CUDA_ADD_CUFFT_TO_TARGET macro)
  CUDA_CUBLAS_LIBRARIES \-\- Device or emulation library for the Cuda BLAS
                           implementation (alterative to:

This module locates the developer's image library. http://openil.sourceforge.net/


This module sets: IL_LIBRARIES the name of the IL library. These include the full path to the core DevIL library. This one has to be linked into the application. ILU_LIBRARIES the name of the ILU library. Again, the full path. This library is for filters and effects, not actual loading. It doesn't have to be linked if the functionality it provides is not used. ILUT_LIBRARIES the name of the ILUT library. Full path. This part of the library interfaces with OpenGL. It is not strictly needed in applications. IL_INCLUDE_DIR where to find the il.h, ilu.h and ilut.h files. IL_FOUND this is set to TRUE if all the above variables were set. This will be set to false if ILU or ILUT are not found, even if they are not needed. In most systems, if one library is found all the others are as well. That's the way the DevIL developers release it.

.B FindFLEX
Find flex executable and provides a macro to generate custom build rules




The module defines the following variables:


.nf
  FLEX_FOUND \- true is flex executable is found
  FLEX_EXECUTABLE \- the path to the flex executable
  FLEX_VERSION \- the version of flex
  FLEX_LIBRARIES \- The flex libraries
.fi




If flex is found on the system, the module provides the macro:


.nf
  FLEX_TARGET(Name FlexInput FlexOutput [COMPILE_FLAGS <string>])
.fi

which creates a custom command  to generate the <FlexOutput> file from the <FlexInput> file.  If  COMPILE_FLAGS option is specified, the next parameter is added to the flex  command line. Name is an alias used to get  details of  this custom  command.  Indeed the  macro defines  the following variables:


.nf
  FLEX_${Name}_DEFINED \- true is the macro ran successfully
  FLEX_${Name}_OUTPUTS \- the source file generated by the custom rule, an
  alias for FlexOutput
  FLEX_${Name}_INPUT \- the flex source file, an alias for ${FlexInput}
.fi




Flex scanners oftenly use tokens  defined by Bison: the code generated by Flex  depends of the header  generated by Bison.   This module also defines a macro:


.nf
  ADD_FLEX_BISON_DEPENDENCY(FlexTarget BisonTarget)
.fi

which  adds the  required dependency  between a  scanner and  a parser where  <FlexTarget>  and <BisonTarget>  are  the  first parameters  of respectively FLEX_TARGET and BISON_TARGET macros.

.B FindHDF5
Find HDF5, a library for reading and writing self describing array data.




This module invokes the HDF5 wrapper compiler that should be installed alongside HDF5.  Depending upon the HDF5 Configuration, the wrapper compiler is called either h5cc or h5pcc.  If this succeeds, the module will then call the compiler with the \-show argument to see what flags are used when compiling an HDF5 client application.


The module will optionally accept the COMPONENTS argument.  If no COMPONENTS are specified, then the find module will default to finding only the HDF5 C library.  If one or more COMPONENTS are specified, the module will attempt to find the language bindings for the specified components.  Currently, the only valid components are C and CXX.  The module does not yet support finding the Fortran bindings.  If the COMPONENTS argument is not given, the module will attempt to find only the C bindings.


On UNIX systems, this module will read the variable HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES to determine whether or not to prefer a static link to a dynamic link for HDF5 and all of it's dependencies.  To use this feature, make sure that the HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES variable is set before the call to find_package.


To provide the module with a hint about where to find your HDF5 installation, you can set the environment variable HDF5_ROOT.  The Find module will then look in this path when searching for HDF5 executables, paths, and libraries.


In addition to finding the includes and libraries required to compile an HDF5 client application, this module also makes an effort to find tools that come with the HDF5 distribution that may be useful for regression testing.


This module will define the following variables:


.nf
  HDF5_INCLUDE_DIR \- Location of the hdf5 includes
  HDF5_DEFINITIONS \- Required compiler definitions for HDF5
  HDF5_C_LIBRARIES \- Required libraries for the HDF5 C bindings.
  HDF5_CXX_LIBRARIES \- Required libraries for the HDF5 C++ bindings
  HDF5_LIBRARIES \- Required libraries for all requested bindings
  HDF5_FOUND \- true if HDF5 was found on the system
  HDF5_LIBRARY_DIRS \- the full set of library directories
  HDF5_IS_PARALLEL \- Whether or not HDF5 was found with parallel IO support
  HDF5_C_COMPILER_EXECUTABLE \- the path to the HDF5 C wrapper compiler

.B FindMPI
Message Passing Interface (MPI) module.




The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a library used to write high\-performance parallel applications that use message passing, and is typically deployed on a cluster. MPI is a standard interface (defined by the MPI forum) for which many implementations are available. All of these implementations have somewhat different compilation approaches (different include paths, libraries to link against, etc.), and this module tries to smooth out those differences.


This module will set the following variables:


.nf
   MPI_FOUND                  TRUE if we have found MPI
   MPI_COMPILE_FLAGS          Compilation flags for MPI programs
   MPI_INCLUDE_PATH           Include path(s) for MPI header
   MPI_LINK_FLAGS             Linking flags for MPI programs
   MPI_LIBRARY                First MPI library to link against (cached)
   MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY          Extra MPI libraries to link against (cached)
   MPI_LIBRARIES              All libraries to link MPI programs against
   MPIEXEC                    Executable for running MPI programs
   MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG       Flag to pass to MPIEXEC before giving it the
                              number of processors to run on
   MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS           Flags to pass to MPIEXEC directly before the
                              executable to run.
   MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS          Flags to pass to MPIEXEC after all other flags.
.fi




This module will attempt to auto\-detect these settings, first by looking for a MPI compiler, which many MPI implementations provide as a pass\-through to the native compiler to simplify the compilation of MPI programs. The MPI compiler is stored in the cache variable MPI_COMPILER, and will attempt to look for commonly\-named drivers mpic++, mpicxx, mpiCC, or mpicc. If the compiler driver is found and recognized, it will be used to set all of the module variables. To skip this auto\-detection, set MPI_LIBRARY and MPI_INCLUDE_PATH in the CMake cache.


If no compiler driver is found or the compiler driver is not recognized, this module will then search for common include paths and library names to try to detect MPI.


If CMake initially finds a different MPI than was intended, and you want to use the MPI compiler auto\-detection for a different MPI implementation, set MPI_COMPILER to the MPI compiler driver you want to use (e.g., mpicxx) and then set MPI_LIBRARY to the string MPI_LIBRARY\-NOTFOUND. When you re\-configure, auto\-detection of MPI will run again with the newly\-specified MPI_COMPILER.


When using MPIEXEC to execute MPI applications, you should typically use all of the MPIEXEC flags as follows:


.nf
   ${MPIEXEC} ${MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG} PROCS ${MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS} EXECUTABLE
     ${MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS} ARGS
.fi

where PROCS is the number of processors on which to execute the program, EXECUTABLE is the MPI program, and ARGS are the arguments to pass to the MPI program.

.nf
    See http://www.openscenegraph.org
.fi




NOTE: To use this module effectively you must either require CMake >= 2.6.3 with cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6.3) or download and place FindOpenThreads.cmake, Findosg_functions.cmake, Findosg.cmake, and Find<etc>.cmake files into your CMAKE_MODULE_PATH.


==================================


This module accepts the following variables (note mixed case)


.nf
    OpenSceneGraph_DEBUG \- Enable debugging output
.fi




.nf
    OpenSceneGraph_MARK_AS_ADVANCED \- Mark cache variables as advanced 
                                      automatically

The following environment variables are also respected for finding the OSG and it's various components.  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH can also be used for this (see find_library() CMake documentation).


.nf
    <MODULE>_DIR (where MODULE is of the form "OSGVOLUME" and there is a FindosgVolume.cmake file)
    OSG_DIR
    OSGDIR
    OSG_ROOT

.B FindOpenThreads
.nf
 
.fi

OpenThreads is a C++ based threading library. Its largest userbase  seems to OpenSceneGraph so you might notice I accept OSGDIR as an environment path. I consider this part of the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph  components. Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module.


Locate OpenThreads This module defines OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY OPENTHREADS_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to OpenThreads OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers


$OPENTHREADS_DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the ./configure \-\-prefix=$OPENTHREADS_DIR used in building osg.

.fi

FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(NAME (DEFAULT_MSG|"Custom failure message") VAR1 ... )


.nf
    This macro is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake modules files.
    It handles the REQUIRED and QUIET argument to FIND_PACKAGE() and
    it also sets the <UPPERCASED_NAME>_FOUND variable.
    The package is found if all variables listed are TRUE.
    Example:
.fi




.nf
    FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS(LibXml2 DEFAULT_MSG LIBXML2_LIBRARIES LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR)
.fi




.nf
    LibXml2 is considered to be found, if both LIBXML2_LIBRARIES and 
    LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR are valid. Then also LIBXML2_FOUND is set to TRUE.
    If it is not found and REQUIRED was used, it fails with FATAL_ERROR, 
    independent whether QUIET was used or not.
    If it is found, the location is reported using the VAR1 argument, so 
    here a message "Found LibXml2: /usr/lib/libxml2.so" will be printed out.
    If the second argument is DEFAULT_MSG, the message in the failure case will 
    be "Could NOT find LibXml2", if you don't like this message you can specify
    your own custom failure message there.
.fi

.TP
.B FindPackageMessage
.nf
 
.fi

FIND_PACKAGE_MESSAGE(<name> "message for user" "find result details")


This macro is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake modules files. It will print a message once for each unique find result. This is useful for telling the user where a package was found. The first argument specifies the name (XXX) of the package. The second argument specifies the message to display. The third argument lists details about the find result so that if they change the message will be displayed again. The macro also obeys the QUIET argument to the find_package command.


Example:


.nf
  IF(X11_FOUND)
    FIND_PACKAGE_MESSAGE(X11 "Found X11: ${X11_X11_LIB}"
      "[${X11_X11_LIB}][${X11_INCLUDE_DIR}]")

.nf
   pkg_search_module(<PREFIX> [REQUIRED] <MODULE> [<MODULE>]*)
     checks for given modules and uses the first working one
.fi




When the 'REQUIRED' argument was set, macros will fail with an error when module(s) could not be found


It sets the following variables:


.nf
   PKG_CONFIG_FOUND         ... true if pkg\-config works on the system
   PKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE    ... pathname of the pkg\-config program
   <PREFIX>_FOUND           ... set to 1 if module(s) exist
.fi




For the following variables two sets of values exist; first one is the common one and has the given PREFIX. The second set contains flags which are given out when pkgconfig was called with the '\-\-static' option.


.nf
   <XPREFIX>_LIBRARIES      ... only the libraries (w/o the '\-l')
   <XPREFIX>_LIBRARY_DIRS   ... the paths of the libraries (w/o the '\-L')
   <XPREFIX>_LDFLAGS        ... all required linker flags
   <XPREFIX>_LDFLAGS_OTHER  ... all other linker flags

   <XPREFIX>_CFLAGS         ... all required cflags
   <XPREFIX>_CFLAGS_OTHER   ... the other compiler flags
.fi




.nf
   <XPREFIX> = <PREFIX>        for common case
   <XPREFIX> = <PREFIX>_STATIC for static linking
.fi




There are some special variables whose prefix depends on the count of given modules. When there is only one module, <PREFIX> stays unchanged. When there are multiple modules, the prefix will be changed to <PREFIX>_<MODNAME>:


.nf
   <XPREFIX>_VERSION    ... version of the module
   <XPREFIX>_PREFIX     ... prefix\-directory of the module
   <XPREFIX>_INCLUDEDIR ... include\-dir of the module
   <XPREFIX>_LIBDIR     ... lib\-dir of the module
.fi




.nf
   <XPREFIX> = <PREFIX>  when |MODULES| == 1, else
   <XPREFIX> = <PREFIX>_<MODNAME>
.fi




A <MODULE> parameter can have the following formats:


.nf
   {MODNAME}            ... matches any version
   {MODNAME}>={VERSION} ... at least version <VERSION> is required
   {MODNAME}={VERSION}  ... exactly version <VERSION> is required
   {MODNAME}<={VERSION} ... modules must not be newer than <VERSION>

.B FindProducer
.nf
 
.fi

Though Producer isn't directly part of OpenSceneGraph, its primary user is OSG so I consider this part of the Findosg* suite used to find  OpenSceneGraph components. You'll notice that I accept OSGDIR as an environment path.


Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module. You must  also opt into OpenGL (and OpenThreads?) as these  modules won't do it for you. This is to allow you control over your own  system piece by piece in case you need to opt out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a particular module (perhaps because the default FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn't work with your system as an example). If you want to use a more convenient module that includes everything, use the FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules.


Locate Producer This module defines PRODUCER_LIBRARY PRODUCER_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to Producer PRODUCER_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers


$PRODUCER_DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the ./configure \-\-prefix=$PRODUCER_DIR used in building osg.

.B FindQt
Searches for all installed versions of QT.

This should only be used if your project can work with multiple versions of QT.  If not, you should just directly use FindQt4 or FindQt3. If multiple versions of QT are found on the machine, then The user must set the option DESIRED_QT_VERSION to the version they want to use.  If only one version of qt is found on the machine, then the DESIRED_QT_VERSION is set to that version and the  matching FindQt3 or FindQt4 module is included. Once the user sets DESIRED_QT_VERSION, then the FindQt3 or FindQt4 module is included.


.nf
  QT_REQUIRED if this is set to TRUE then if CMake can 
              not find QT4 or QT3 an error is raised

  QT_LIBRARIES   \- the libraries to link against to use Qt.
  QT_DEFINITIONS \- definitions to use when

  QT_UIC_EXECUTABLE, where to find the uic tool.
  QT_QT_LIBRARY, where to find the Qt library.
  QT_QTMAIN_LIBRARY, where to find the qtmain
   library. This is only required by Qt3 on Windows.
.fi

.TP
.B FindQt4
Find QT 4

This module can be used to find Qt4. The most important issue is that the Qt4 qmake is available via the system path. This qmake is then used to detect basically everything else. This module defines a number of key variables and macros.  The variable QT_USE_FILE is set which is the path to a CMake file that can be included  to compile Qt 4 applications and libraries.  It sets up the compilation environment for include directories, preprocessor defines and populates a QT_LIBRARIES variable.


Typical usage could be something like:


.nf
   find_package(Qt4 4.4.3 COMPONENTS QtCore QtGui QtXml REQUIRED )
   include(${QT_USE_FILE})
   add_executable(myexe main.cpp)
   target_link_libraries(myexe ${QT_LIBRARIES})
.fi




The minimum required version can be specified using the standard find_package()\-syntax (see example above).  For compatibility with older versions of FindQt4.cmake it is also possible to set the variable QT_MIN_VERSION to the minimum required version of Qt4 before the  find_package(Qt4) command.  If both are used, the version used in the find_package() command overrides the one from QT_MIN_VERSION.


When using the components argument, QT_USE_QT* variables are automatically set for the QT_USE_FILE to pick up.  If one wishes to manually set them, the available ones to set include:


.nf
                    QT_DONT_USE_QTCORE

There are also some files that need processing by some Qt tools such as moc and uic.  Listed below are macros that may be used to process those files.


.nf
  
  macro QT4_WRAP_CPP(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
        create moc code from a list of files containing Qt class with
        the Q_OBJECT declaration.  Per\-direcotry preprocessor definitions 
        are also added.  Options may be given to moc, such as those found
        when executing "moc \-help".  
.fi

  macro QT4_ADD_RESOURCES(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
        create code from a list of Qt resource files.
        Options may be given to rcc, such as those found
        when executing "rcc \-help"
.fi




.nf
  macro QT4_GENERATE_MOC(inputfile outputfile )
        creates a rule to run moc on infile and create outfile.
        Use this if for some reason QT4_WRAP_CPP() isn't appropriate, e.g.
        because you need a custom filename for the moc file or something similar.
.fi




.nf
  macro QT4_AUTOMOC(sourcefile1 sourcefile2 ... )
        This macro is still experimental.
        It can be used to have moc automatically handled.
        So if you have the files foo.h and foo.cpp, and in foo.h a 
        a class uses the Q_OBJECT macro, moc has to run on it. If you don't
        want to use QT4_WRAP_CPP() (which is reliable and mature), you can insert
        #include "foo.moc"
        in foo.cpp and then give foo.cpp as argument to QT4_AUTOMOC(). This will the
        scan all listed files at cmake\-time for such included moc files and if it finds
        them cause a rule to be generated to run moc at build time on the 
        accompanying header file foo.h.
        If a source file has the SKIP_AUTOMOC property set it will be ignored by this macro.

Locate SDL library This module defines SDL_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against SDL_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL SDL_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL.h


This module responds to the the flag: SDL_BUILDING_LIBRARY If this is defined, then no SDL_main will be linked in because  only applications need main(). Otherwise, it is assumed you are building an application and this module will attempt to locate and set the the proper link flags as part of the returned SDL_LIBRARY variable.


Don't forget to include SDLmain.h and SDLmain.m your project for the  OS X framework based version. (Other versions link to \-lSDLmain which this module will try to find on your behalf.) Also for OS X, this  module will automatically add the \-framework Cocoa on your behalf.





Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP in your configuration and no SDL_LIBRARY, it means CMake did not find your SDL library  (SDL.dll, libsdl.so, SDL.framework, etc).  Set SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP to point to your SDL library, and configure again.  Similarly, if you see an empty SDLMAIN_LIBRARY, you should set this value as appropriate. These values are used to generate the final SDL_LIBRARY variable, but when these values are unset, SDL_LIBRARY does not get created.





$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the ./configure \-\-prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL. l.e.galup  9\-20\-02


Modified by Eric Wing.  Added code to assist with automated building by using environmental variables and providing a more controlled/consistent search behavior. Added new modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and  additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).  Also corrected the header search path to follow "proper" SDL guidelines. Added a search for SDLmain which is needed by some platforms. Added a search for threads which is needed by some platforms. Added needed compile switches for MinGW.


On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others. People will have to manually change the cache values of  SDL_LIBRARY to override this selection or set the CMake environment CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.


Note that the header path has changed from SDL/SDL.h to just SDL.h This needed to change because "proper" SDL convention is #include "SDL.h", not <SDL/SDL.h>. This is done for portability reasons because not all systems place things in SDL/ (see FreeBSD).

  TCL_FOUND              = Tcl was found
  TK_FOUND               = Tk was found
  TCLTK_FOUND            = Tcl and Tk were found
  TCL_LIBRARY            = path to Tcl library (tcl tcl80)
  TCL_INCLUDE_PATH       = path to where tcl.h can be found
  TCL_TCLSH              = path to tclsh binary (tcl tcl80)
  TK_LIBRARY             = path to Tk library (tk tk80 etc)

  TK_WISH                = full path to the wish executable
.fi




In an effort to remove some clutter and clear up some issues for people who are not necessarily Tcl/Tk gurus/developpers, some variables were moved or removed. Changes compared to CMake 2.4 are:


.nf
   => they were only useful for people writing Tcl/Tk extensions.
   => these libs are not packaged by default with Tcl/Tk distributions. 
      Even when Tcl/Tk is built from source, several flavors of debug libs
      are created and there is no real reason to pick a single one
      specifically (say, amongst tcl84g, tcl84gs, or tcl84sgx). 
      Let's leave that choice to the user by allowing him to assign 
      TCL_LIBRARY to any Tcl library, debug or not.
   => this ended up being only a Win32 variable, and there is a lot of
      confusion regarding the location of this file in an installed Tcl/Tk
      tree anyway (see 8.5 for example). If you need the internal path at
      this point it is safer you ask directly where the *source* tree is
      and dig from there.

NOTE: It is highly recommended that you use the new FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake introduced in CMake 2.6.3 and not use this Find module directly.


This is part of the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph components. Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module. You must  also opt into OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Producer if needed) as these  modules won't do it for you. This is to allow you control over your own  system piece by piece in case you need to opt out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a particular module (perhaps because the default FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn't work with your system as an example). If you want to use a more convenient module that includes everything, use the FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules.

This is part of the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph components. Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module. You must  also opt into OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Producer if needed) as these  modules won't do it for you. This is to allow you control over your own  system piece by piece in case you need to opt out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a particular module (perhaps because the default FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn't work with your system as an example).

This CMake file contains two macros to assist with searching for OSG libraries and nodekits.


.TP
.B FindwxWidgets
Find a wxWidgets (a.k.a., wxWindows) installation.

This module finds if wxWidgets is installed and selects a default configuration to use. wxWidgets is a modular library. To specify the modules that you will use, you need to name them as components to the package:


FIND_PACKAGE(wxWidgets COMPONENTS base core ...)


There are two search branches: a windows style and a unix style. For windows, the following variables are searched for and set to defaults in case of multiple choices. Change them if the defaults are not desired (i.e., these are the only variables you should change to select a configuration):


.nf
  wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR      \- Base wxWidgets directory
                            (e.g., C:/wxWidgets\-2.6.3).
  wxWidgets_LIB_DIR       \- Path to wxWidgets libraries
                            (e.g., C:/wxWidgets\-2.6.3/lib/vc_lib).
  wxWidgets_CONFIGURATION \- Configuration to use
                            (e.g., msw, mswd, mswu, mswunivud, etc.)
.fi




For unix style it uses the wx\-config utility. You can select between debug/release, unicode/ansi, universal/non\-universal, and static/shared in the QtDialog or ccmake interfaces by turning ON/OFF the following variables:


.nf
  wxWidgets_USE_DEBUG
  wxWidgets_USE_UNICODE
  wxWidgets_USE_UNIVERSAL
  wxWidgets_USE_STATIC
  
.fi

The following are set after the configuration is done for both windows and unix style:


.nf
  wxWidgets_FOUND            \- Set to TRUE if wxWidgets was found.
  wxWidgets_INCLUDE_DIRS     \- Include directories for WIN32
                               i.e., where to find "wx/wx.h" and
                               "wx/setup.h"; possibly empty for unices.
  wxWidgets_LIBRARIES        \- Path to the wxWidgets libraries.
  wxWidgets_LIBRARY_DIRS     \- compile time link dirs, useful for
                               rpath on UNIX. Typically an empty string
                               in WIN32 environment.
  wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS      \- Contains defines required to compile/link
                               against WX, e.g. WXUSINGDLL
  wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG\- Contains defines required to compile/link
                               against WX debug builds, e.g. __WXDEBUG__
  wxWidgets_CXX_FLAGS        \- Include dirs and compiler flags for
                               unices, empty on WIN32. Essentially
                               "`wx\-config \-\-cxxflags`".
  wxWidgets_USE_FILE         \- Convenience include file.
.fi




Sample usage:


.nf
   FIND_PACKAGE(wxWidgets COMPONENTS base core gl net)
   IF(wxWidgets_FOUND)
     INCLUDE(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE})
     # and for each of your dependant executable/library targets:
     TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(<YourTarget> ${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})
   ENDIF(wxWidgets_FOUND)
.fi




If wxWidgets is required (i.e., not an optional part):


.nf
   FIND_PACKAGE(wxWidgets REQUIRED base core gl net)
   INCLUDE(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE})
   # and for each of your dependant executable/library targets:
   TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(<YourTarget> ${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})
.fi

.TP
.B FindwxWindows
Find wxWindows (wxWidgets) installation

This module finds if wxWindows/wxWidgets is installed and determines where the include files and libraries are. It also determines what the name of the library is. Please note this file is DEPRECATED and replaced by FindwxWidgets.cmake. This code sets the following variables:


.nf
  WXWINDOWS_FOUND     = system has WxWindows
  WXWINDOWS_LIBRARIES = path to the wxWindows libraries
                        on Unix/Linux with additional
                        linker flags from
                        "wx\-config \-\-libs"
  CMAKE_WXWINDOWS_CXX_FLAGS  = Compiler flags for wxWindows,
                               essentially "`wx\-config \-\-cxxflags`"
                               on Linux
  WXWINDOWS_INCLUDE_DIR      = where to find "wx/wx.h" and "wx/setup.h"
  WXWINDOWS_LINK_DIRECTORIES = link directories, useful for rpath on
                                Unix
  WXWINDOWS_DEFINITIONS      = extra defines
.fi

.B FortranCInterface
Fortran/C Interface Detection

This module automatically detects the API by which C and Fortran languages interact.  Variables indicate if the mangling is found:


.nf
   FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_FOUND = Global subroutines and functions
   FortranCInterface_MODULE_FOUND = Module subroutines and functions
                                    (declared by "MODULE PROCEDURE")
.fi

A function is provided to generate a C header file containing macros to mangle symbol names:


.nf
   FortranCInterface_HEADER(<file>
                            [MACRO_NAMESPACE <macro\-ns>]
                            [SYMBOL_NAMESPACE <ns>]
                            [SYMBOLS [<module>:]<function> ...])
.fi

It generates in <file> definitions of the following macros:


.nf
   #define FortranCInterface_GLOBAL (name,NAME) ...
   #define FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_(name,NAME) ...
   #define FortranCInterface_MODULE (mod,name, MOD,NAME) ...
   #define FortranCInterface_MODULE_(mod,name, MOD,NAME) ...
.fi

These macros mangle four categories of Fortran symbols, respectively:


.nf
   \- Global symbols without '_': call mysub()
   \- Global symbols with '_'   : call my_sub()
   \- Module symbols without '_': use mymod; call mysub()
   \- Module symbols with '_'   : use mymod; call my_sub()
.fi

If mangling for a category is not known, its macro is left undefined. All macros require raw names in both lower case and upper case. The MACRO_NAMESPACE option replaces the default "FortranCInterface_" prefix with a given namespace "<macro\-ns>".


The SYMBOLS option lists symbols to mangle automatically with C preprocessor definitions:


.nf
   <function>          ==> #define <ns><function> ...
   <module>:<function> ==> #define <ns><module>_<function> ...
.fi

If the mangling for some symbol is not known then no preprocessor definition is created, and a warning is displayed. The SYMBOL_NAMESPACE option prefixes all preprocessor definitions generated by the SYMBOLS option with a given namespace "<ns>".


Example usage:


.nf
   include(FortranCInterface)
   FortranCInterface_HEADER(FC.h MACRO_NAMESPACE "FC_")
.fi

This creates a "FC.h" header that defines mangling macros FC_GLOBAL(), FC_GLOBAL_(), FC_MODULE(), and FC_MODULE_().


Example usage:


.nf
   include(FortranCInterface)
   FortranCInterface_HEADER(FCMangle.h
                            MACRO_NAMESPACE "FC_"
                            SYMBOL_NAMESPACE "FC_"
                            SYMBOLS mysub mymod:my_sub)
.fi

This creates a "FC.h" header that defines the same FC_*() mangling macros as the previous example plus preprocessor symbols FC_mysub and FC_mymod_my_sub.


Another function is provided to verify that the Fortran and C/C++ compilers work together:


.nf
   FortranCInterface_VERIFY([CXX] [QUIET])
.fi

It tests whether a simple test executable using Fortran and C (and C++ when the CXX option is given) compiles and links successfully. The result is stored in the cache entry FortranCInterface_VERIFIED_C (or FortranCInterface_VERIFIED_CXX if CXX is given) as a boolean. If the check fails and QUIET is not given the function terminates with a FATAL_ERROR message describing the problem.  The purpose of this check is to stop a build early for incompatible compiler combinations.


FortranCInterface is aware of possible GLOBAL and MODULE manglings for many Fortran compilers, but it also provides an interface to specify new possible manglings.  Set the variables


.nf
   FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS
   FortranCInterface_MODULE_SYMBOLS
.fi

before including FortranCInterface to specify manglings of the symbols "MySub", "My_Sub", "MyModule:MySub", and "My_Module:My_Sub". For example, the code:


.nf
   set(FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS mysub_ my_sub__ MYSUB_)
     #                                  ^^^^^  ^^^^^^   ^^^^^
   set(FortranCInterface_MODULE_SYMBOLS
       __mymodule_MOD_mysub __my_module_MOD_my_sub)
     #   ^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^^
   include(FortranCInterface)
.fi

tells FortranCInterface to try given GLOBAL and MODULE manglings. (The carets point at raw symbol names for clarity in this example but are not needed.)

.TP
.B GetPrerequisites
.nf
 
.fi

GetPrerequisites.cmake


This script provides functions to list the .dll, .dylib or .so files that an executable or shared library file depends on. (Its prerequisites.)


It uses various tools to obtain the list of required shared library files:


.nf
   dumpbin (Windows)
   ldd (Linux/Unix)
   otool (Mac OSX)
.fi




The following functions are provided by this script:


.nf
   gp_append_unique
   is_file_executable
   gp_item_default_embedded_path
     (projects can override with gp_item_default_embedded_path_override)
   gp_resolve_item
     (projects can override with gp_resolve_item_override)
   gp_resolved_file_type
   gp_file_type
   get_prerequisites
   list_prerequisites
   list_prerequisites_by_glob
.fi




Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function, break, return and PARENT_SCOPE.

.TP
.B InstallRequiredSystemLibraries
.nf
 
.fi

By including this file, all files in the CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES, will be installed with INSTALL_PROGRAMS into /bin for WIN32 and /lib for non\-win32. If CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RULES is set to TRUE before including this file, then the INSTALL command is not called.  The use can use  the variable CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS to use a custom install  command and install them into any directory they want. If it is the MSVC compiler, then the microsoft run time libraries will be found add automatically added to the CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES, and installed.   If CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES is set and it is the MSVC compiler, then the debug libraries are installed when available. If CMAKE_INSTALL_MFC_LIBRARIES is set then the MFC run time libraries are installed as well as the CRT run time libraries.

.TP
.B MacroAddFileDependencies
MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(<_file> depend_files...)

Using the macro MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES() is discouraged. There are usually better ways to specifiy the correct dependencies.


MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(<_file> depend_files...) is just a convenience  wrapper around the OBJECT_DEPENDS source file property. You can just use SET_PROPERTY(SOURCE <file> APPEND PROPERTY OBJECT_DEPENDS depend_files) instead.

.TP
.B SelectLibraryConfigurations
.nf
 
.fi

select_library_configurations( basename )


This macro takes a library base name as an argument, and will choose good values for basename_LIBRARY, basename_LIBRARIES, basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG, and basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE depending on what has been found and set.  If only basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE is defined, basename_LIBRARY, basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG, and basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE will be set to the release value.  If only basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG is defined, then basename_LIBRARY, basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG and basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE will take the debug value.  


If the generator supports configuration types, then basename_LIBRARY and basename_LIBRARIES will be set with debug and optimized flags specifying the library to be used for the given configuration.  If no build type has been set or the generator in use does not support configuration types, then basename_LIBRARY and basename_LIBRARIES will take only the release values.

.TP
.B SquishTestScript
.nf
 
.fi




This script launches a GUI test using Squish.  You should not call the script directly; instead, you should access it via the SQUISH_ADD_TEST macro that is defined in FindSquish.cmake.


This script starts the Squish server, launches the test on the client, and finally stops the squish server.  If any of these steps fail (including if the tests do not pass) then a fatal error is raised.

All other macros are for internal use only. To get the actual name of the swig module, use: ${SWIG_MODULE_${name}_REAL_NAME}. Set Source files properties such as CPLUSPLUS and SWIG_FLAGS to specify special behavior of SWIG. Also global CMAKE_SWIG_FLAGS can be used to add special flags to all swig calls. Another special variable is CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR, it allows one to specify  where to write all the swig generated module (swig \-outdir option) The name\-specific variable SWIG_MODULE_<name>_EXTRA_DEPS may be used to specify extra dependencies for the generated modules. If the source file generated by swig need some special flag you can use SET_SOURCE_FILES_PROPERTIES( ${swig_generated_file_fullname}

.SH POLICIES
.TP
.B CMP0000
A minimum required CMake version must be specified.

CMake requires that projects specify the version of CMake to which they have been written.  This policy has been put in place so users trying to build the project may be told when they need to update their CMake.  Specifying a version also helps the project build with CMake versions newer than that specified.  Use the cmake_minimum_required command at the top of your main  CMakeLists.txt file:


.nf
  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION <major>.<minor>)
.fi

where "<major>.<minor>" is the version of CMake you want to support (such as "2.6").  The command will ensure that at least the given version of CMake is running and help newer versions be compatible with the project.  See documentation of cmake_minimum_required for details.


Note that the command invocation must appear in the CMakeLists.txt file itself; a call in an included file is not sufficient.  However, the cmake_policy command may be called to set policy CMP0000 to OLD or NEW behavior explicitly.  The OLD behavior is to silently ignore the missing invocation.  The NEW behavior is to issue an error instead of a warning.  An included file may set CMP0000 explicitly to affect how this policy is enforced for the main CMakeLists.txt file.


This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.

.TP
.B CMP0001
CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY should no longer be used.

The OLD behavior is to check CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY and present it to the user.  The NEW behavior is to ignore CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY completely.


In CMake 2.4 and below the variable CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY was used to request compatibility with earlier versions of CMake.  In CMake 2.6 and above all compatibility issues are handled by policies and the cmake_policy command.  However, CMake must still check CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY for projects written for CMake 2.4 and below.


This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.  CMake version 2.8.0 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.

.TP
.B CMP0002
Logical target names must be globally unique.

Targets names created with add_executable, add_library, or add_custom_target are logical build target names.  Logical target names must be globally unique because:


.nf
  \- Unique names may be referenced unambiguously both in CMake
    code and on make tool command lines.
  \- Logical names are used by Xcode and VS IDE generators
    to produce meaningful project names for the targets.
.fi

The logical name of executable and library targets does not have to correspond to the physical file names built.  Consider using the OUTPUT_NAME target property to create two targets with the same physical name while keeping logical names distinct.  Custom targets must simply have globally unique names (unless one uses the global property ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS with a Makefiles generator).


This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.  CMake version 2.8.0 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.

.TP
.B CMP0003
Libraries linked via full path no longer produce linker search paths.

This policy affects how libraries whose full paths are NOT known are found at link time, but was created due to a change in how CMake deals with libraries whose full paths are known.  Consider the code


.nf
  target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so)
.fi

CMake 2.4 and below implemented linking to libraries whose full paths are known by splitting them on the link line into separate components consisting of the linker search path and the library name.  The example code might have produced something like


.nf
  ... \-L/path/to \-lA ...
.fi

in order to link to library A.  An analysis was performed to order multiple link directories such that the linker would find library A in the desired location, but there are cases in which this does not work.  CMake versions 2.6 and above use the more reliable approach of passing the full path to libraries directly to the linker in most cases.  The example code now produces something like


.nf
  ... /path/to/libA.so ....
.fi

Unfortunately this change can break code like


.nf
  target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)
.fi

where "B" is meant to find "/path/to/libB.so".  This code is wrong because the user is asking the linker to find library B but has not provided a linker search path (which may be added with the link_directories command).  However, with the old linking implementation the code would work accidentally because the linker search path added for library A allowed library B to be found.


In order to support projects depending on linker search paths added by linking to libraries with known full paths, the OLD behavior for this policy will add the linker search paths even though they are not needed for their own libraries.  When this policy is set to OLD, CMake will produce a link line such as


.nf
  ... \-L/path/to /path/to/libA.so \-lB ...
.fi

which will allow library B to be found as it was previously.  When this policy is set to NEW, CMake will produce a link line such as


.nf
  ... /path/to/libA.so \-lB ...
.fi

which more accurately matches what the project specified.


The setting for this policy used when generating the link line is that in effect when the target is created by an add_executable or add_library command.  For the example described above, the code


.nf
  cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 OLD) # or cmake_policy(VERSION 2.4)
  add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
  target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)
.fi

will work and suppress the warning for this policy.  It may also be updated to work with the corrected linking approach:


.nf
  cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 NEW) # or cmake_policy(VERSION 2.6)
  link_directories(/path/to) # needed to find library B
  add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
  target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)
.fi

Even better, library B may be specified with a full path:


.nf
  add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
  target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so /path/to/libB.so)
.fi

When all items on the link line have known paths CMake does not check this policy so it has no effect.


Note that the warning for this policy will be issued for at most one target.  This avoids flooding users with messages for every target when setting the policy once will probably fix all targets.


This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.  CMake version 2.8.0 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.

.TP
.B CMP0004
Libraries linked may not have leading or trailing whitespace.

CMake versions 2.4 and below silently removed leading and trailing whitespace from libraries linked with code like


.nf
  target_link_libraries(myexe " A ")
.fi

This could lead to subtle errors in user projects.


The OLD behavior for this policy is to silently remove leading and trailing whitespace.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to diagnose the existence of such whitespace as an error.  The setting for this policy used when checking the library names is that in effect when the target is created by an add_executable or add_library command.


This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.  CMake version 2.8.0 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.

.TP
.B CMP0005
Preprocessor definition values are now escaped automatically.

This policy determines whether or not CMake should generate escaped preprocessor definition values added via add_definitions.  CMake versions 2.4 and below assumed that only trivial values would be given for macros in add_definitions calls.  It did not attempt to escape non\-trivial values such as string literals in generated build rules.  CMake versions 2.6 and above support escaping of most values, but cannot assume the user has not added escapes already in an attempt to work around limitations in earlier versions.


The OLD behavior for this policy is to place definition values given to add_definitions directly in the generated build rules without attempting to escape anything.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to generate correct escapes for all native build tools automatically.  See documentation of the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS target property for limitations of the escaping implementation.


This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.  CMake version 2.8.0 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.

.TP
.B CMP0006
Installing MACOSX_BUNDLE targets requires a BUNDLE DESTINATION.

This policy determines whether the install(TARGETS) command must be given a BUNDLE DESTINATION when asked to install a target with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set.  CMake 2.4 and below did not distinguish application bundles from normal executables when installing targets.  CMake 2.6 provides a BUNDLE option to the install(TARGETS) command that specifies rules specific to application bundles on the Mac.  Projects should use this option when installing a target with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set.


The OLD behavior for this policy is to fall back to the RUNTIME DESTINATION if a BUNDLE DESTINATION is not given.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to produce an error if a bundle target is installed without a BUNDLE DESTINATION.


This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.  CMake version 2.8.0 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.

.TP
.B CMP0007
list command no longer ignores empty elements.

This policy determines whether the list command will ignore empty elements in the list. CMake 2.4 and below list commands ignored all empty elements in the list.  For example, a;b;;c would have length 3 and not 4. The OLD behavior for this policy is to ignore empty list elements. The NEW behavior for this policy is to correctly count empty elements in a list. 


This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.  CMake version 2.8.0 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.

.TP
.B CMP0008
Libraries linked by full\-path must have a valid library file name.

In CMake 2.4 and below it is possible to write code like


.nf
  target_link_libraries(myexe /full/path/to/somelib)
.fi

where "somelib" is supposed to be a valid library file name such as "libsomelib.a" or "somelib.lib".  For Makefile generators this produces an error at build time because the dependency on the full path cannot be found.  For VS IDE and Xcode generators this used to work by accident because CMake would always split off the library directory and ask the linker to search for the library by name (\-lsomelib or somelib.lib).  Despite the failure with Makefiles, some projects have code like this and build only with VS and/or Xcode.  This version of CMake prefers to pass the full path directly to the native build tool, which will fail in this case because it does not name a valid library file.


This policy determines what to do with full paths that do not appear to name a valid library file.  The OLD behavior for this policy is to split the library name from the path and ask the linker to search for it.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to trust the given path and pass it directly to the native build tool unchanged.


This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.1.  CMake version 2.8.0 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.

FILE GLOB_RECURSE calls should not follow symlinks by default.

In CMake 2.6.1 and below, FILE GLOB_RECURSE calls would follow through symlinks, sometimes coming up with unexpectedly large result sets because of symlinks to top level directories that contain hundreds of thousands of files.


This policy determines whether or not to follow symlinks encountered during a FILE GLOB_RECURSE call. The OLD behavior for this policy is to follow the symlinks. The NEW behavior for this policy is not to follow the symlinks by default, but only if FOLLOW_SYMLINKS is given as an additional argument to the FILE command.


This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.2.  CMake version 2.8.0 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.

Bad variable reference syntax is an error.

In CMake 2.6.2 and below, incorrect variable reference syntax such as a missing close\-brace ("${FOO") was reported but did not stop processing of CMake code.  This policy determines whether a bad variable reference is an error.  The OLD behavior for this policy is to warn about the error, leave the string untouched, and continue. The NEW behavior for this policy is to report an error.


This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.3.  CMake version 2.8.0 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.

.B CMP0011
Included scripts do automatic cmake_policy PUSH and POP.

In CMake 2.6.2 and below, CMake Policy settings in scripts loaded by the include() and find_package() commands would affect the includer.  Explicit invocations of cmake_policy(PUSH) and cmake_policy(POP) were required to isolate policy changes and protect the includer.  While some scripts intend to affect the policies of their includer, most do not.  In CMake 2.6.3 and above, include() and find_package() by default PUSH and POP an entry on the policy stack around an included script, but provide a NO_POLICY_SCOPE option to disable it.  This policy determines whether or not to imply NO_POLICY_SCOPE for compatibility.  The OLD behavior for this policy is to imply NO_POLICY_SCOPE for include() and find_package() commands.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to allow the commands to do their default cmake_policy PUSH and POP.

.B CMP0012
if() recognizes numbers and boolean constants.

In CMake versions 2.6.4 and lower the if() command implicitly dereferenced arguments corresponding to variables, even those named like numbers or boolean constants, except for 0 and 1.  Numbers and boolean constants such as true, false, yes, no, on, off, y, n, notfound, ignore (all case insensitive) were recognized in some cases but not all.  For example, the code "if(TRUE)" might have evaluated as false.  Numbers such as 2 were recognized only in boolean expressions like "if(NOT 2)" (leading to false) but not as a single\-argument like "if(2)" (also leading to false). Later versions of CMake prefer to treat numbers and boolean constants literally, so they should not be used as variable names.


The OLD behavior for this policy is to implicitly dereference variables named like numbers and boolean constants. The NEW behavior for this policy is to recognize numbers and boolean constants without dereferencing variables with such names.


This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.0.  CMake version 2.8.0 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.

.TP
.B CMP0013
Duplicate binary directories are not allowed.

CMake 2.6.3 and below silently permitted add_subdirectory() calls to create the same binary directory multiple times.  During build system generation files would be written and then overwritten in the build tree and could lead to strange behavior.  CMake 2.6.4 and above explicitly detect duplicate binary directories.  CMake 2.6.4 always considers this case an error.  In CMake 2.8.0 and above this policy determines whether or not the case is an error.  The OLD behavior for this policy is to allow duplicate binary directories.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to disallow duplicate binary directories with an error.


This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.0.  CMake version 2.8.0 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.

Input directories must have CMakeLists.txt.

CMake versions before 2.8 silently ignored missing CMakeLists.txt files in directories referenced by add_subdirectory() or subdirs(), treating them as if present but empty.  In CMake 2.8.0 and above this policy determines whether or not the case is an error.  The OLD behavior for this policy is to silently ignore the problem.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to report an error.


This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.0.  CMake version 2.8.0 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.

.SH VARIABLES THAT CHANGE BEHAVIOR
.TP
.B BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
Global flag to cause add_library to create shared libraries if on.

If present and true, this will cause all libraries to be built shared unless the library was explicitly added as a static library.  This variable is often added to projects as an OPTION so that each user of a project can decide if they want to build the project using shared or static libraries.

.TP
.B CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY
Version of cmake required to build project

From the point of view of backwards compatibility, this specifies what version of CMake should be supported. By default this value is the version number of CMake that you are running. You can set this to an older version of CMake to support deprecated commands of CMake in projects that were written to use older versions of CMake. This can be set by the user or set at the beginning of a CMakeLists file.

.TP
.B CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
Specifies the build type for make based generators.

This specifies what build type will be built in this tree.  Possible values are empty, Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo and MinSizeRel. This variable is only supported for make based generators. If this variable is supported, then CMake will also provide initial values for the variables with the name  CMAKE_C_FLAGS_[Debug|Release|RelWithDebInfo|MinSizeRel]. For example, if CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is Debug, then CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG will be added to the CMAKE_C_FLAGS.

.TP
.B CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE
Enables color output when using the Makefile generator.

When enabled, the generated Makefiles will produce colored output. Default is ON.

.TP
.B CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES
Specifies the available build types.

This specifies what build types will be available such as Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo etc. This has reasonable defaults on most platforms. But can be extended to provide other build types. See also CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.

.TP
.B CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES
Prefixes to prepend when looking for libraries.

This specifies what prefixes to add to library names when the find_library command looks for libraries. On UNIX systems this is typically lib, meaning that when trying to find the foo library it will look for libfoo.

.TP
.B CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES
Suffixes to append when looking for libraries.

This specifies what suffixes to add to library names when the find_library command looks for libraries. On Windows systems this is typically .lib and .dll, meaning that when trying to find the foo library it will look for foo.dll etc.

.TP
.B CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
Path used for searching by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().

Specifies a path which will be used both by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH(). Both commands will check each of the contained directories for the existence of the file which is currently searched. By default it is empty, it is intended to be set by the project. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.

.TP
.B CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
Install directory used by install.

If "make install" is invoked or INSTALL is built, this directory is pre\-pended onto all install directories. This variable defaults to /usr/local on UNIX and c:/Program Files on Windows.

.TP
.B CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
Path used for searching by FIND_LIBRARY().

Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_LIBRARY(). FIND_LIBRARY() will check each of the contained directories for the existence of the library which is currently searched. By default it is empty, it is intended to be set by the project. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH, CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.

.TP
.B CMAKE_MFC_FLAG
Tell cmake to use MFC for an executable or dll.

This can be set in a CMakeLists.txt file and will enable MFC in the application.  It should be set to 1 for static the static MFC library, and 2 for the shared MFC library.  This is used in visual studio 6 and 7 project files.   The CMakeSetup dialog used MFC and the CMakeLists.txt looks like this:


add_definitions(\-D_AFXDLL)


set(CMAKE_MFC_FLAG 2)


add_executable(CMakeSetup WIN32 ${SRCS})


.TP
.B CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
Path to look for cmake modules to load.

Specifies a path to override the default search path for CMake modules. For example include commands will look in this path first for modules to include.

.TP
.B CMAKE_NOT_USING_CONFIG_FLAGS
Skip _BUILD_TYPE flags if true.

This is an internal flag used by the generators in CMake to tell CMake to skip the _BUILD_TYPE flags.

.TP
.B CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
Path used for searching by FIND_XXX(), with appropriate suffixes added.

Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX() commands. It contains the "base" directories, the FIND_XXX() commands append appropriate subdirectories to the base directories. So FIND_PROGRAM() adds /bin to each of the directories in the path, FIND_LIBRARY() appends /lib to each of the directories, and FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() append /include . By default it is empty, it is intended to be set by the project. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH, CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH.

.TP
.B CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
Path used for searching by FIND_PROGRAM().

Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM(). FIND_PROGRAM() will check each of the contained directories for the existence of the program which is currently searched. By default it is empty, it is intended to be set by the project. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH,  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.

.TP
.B CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY
Don't make the install target depend on the all target.

By default, the "install" target depends on the "all" target. This has the effect, that when "make install" is invoked or INSTALL is built, first the "all" target is built, then the installation starts. If CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY is set to TRUE, this dependency is not created, so the installation process will start immediately, independent from whether the project has been completely built or not.

.TP
.B CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
Path used for searching by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH().

Specifies a path which will be used both by FIND_FILE() and FIND_PATH(). Both commands will check each of the contained directories for the existence of the file which is currently searched. By default it contains the standard directories for the current system. It is NOT intended to be modified by the project, use CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH for this. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.

.TP
.B CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH
Path used for searching by FIND_LIBRARY().

Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_LIBRARY(). FIND_LIBRARY() will check each of the contained directories for the existence of the library which is currently searched. By default it contains the standard directories for the current system. It is NOT intended to be modified by the project, use CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH for this. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.

.TP
.B CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
Path used for searching by FIND_XXX(), with appropriate suffixes added.

Specifies a path which will be used by the FIND_XXX() commands. It contains the "base" directories, the FIND_XXX() commands append appropriate subdirectories to the base directories. So FIND_PROGRAM() adds /bin to each of the directories in the path, FIND_LIBRARY() appends /lib to each of the directories, and FIND_PATH() and FIND_FILE() append /include . By default this contains the standard directories for the current system. It is NOT intended to be modified by the project, use CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH for this. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH, CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH, CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH.

.B CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH
Path used for searching by FIND_PROGRAM().

Specifies a path which will be used by FIND_PROGRAM(). FIND_PROGRAM() will check each of the contained directories for the existence of the program which is currently searched. By default it contains the standard directories for the current system. It is NOT intended to be modified by the project, use CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH for this. See also CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.

.TP
.B CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE
Specify a file that can change the build rule variables.

If this variable is set, it should to point to a CMakeLists.txt file that will be read in by CMake after all the system settings have been set, but before they have been used.  This would allow you to override any variables that need to be changed for some special project.

Set to true when the host system is Windows and on cygwin.

.TP
.B CMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX
Maximum object file full\-path length allowed by native build tools.

CMake computes for every source file an object file name that is unique to the source file and deterministic with respect to the full path to the source file.  This allows multiple source files in a target to share the same name if they lie in different directories without rebuilding when one is added or removed.  However, it can produce long full paths in a few cases, so CMake shortens the path using a hashing scheme when the full path to an object file exceeds a limit.  CMake has a built\-in limit for each platform that is sufficient for common tools, but some native tools may have a lower limit.  This variable may be set to specify the limit explicitly.  The value must be an integer no less than 128.

.TP
.B CMAKE_SYSTEM
Name of system cmake is compiling for.

This variable is the composite of CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME and CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION, like this ${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}\-${CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION}. If CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION is not set, then CMAKE_SYSTEM is the same as CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME.

.TP
.B CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME

.TP
.B CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
Directories implicitly searched by the compiler for header files.

CMake does not explicitly specify these directories on compiler command lines for language <LANG>.  This prevents system include directories from being treated as user include directories on some compilers.

.TP
.B CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES
Implicit linker search path detected for language <LANG>.

Compilers typically pass directories containing language runtime libraries and default library search paths when they invoke a linker.  These paths are implicit linker search directories for the compiler's language.  CMake automatically detects these directories for each language and reports the results in this variable.

.TP
.B CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES
Implicit link libraries and flags detected for language <LANG>.

Compilers typically pass language runtime library names and other flags when they invoke a linker.  These flags are implicit link options for the compiler's language.  CMake automatically detects these libraries and flags for each language and reports the results in this variable.

.TP
.B CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE
Preference value for linker language selection.

The "linker language" for executable, shared library, and module targets is the language whose compiler will invoke the linker.  The LINKER_LANGUAGE target property sets the language explicitly.  Otherwise, the linker language is that whose linker preference value is highest among languages compiled and linked into the target.  See also the CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES variable.

.TP
.B CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES
True if CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE propagates across targets.

This is used when CMake selects a linker language for a target.  Languages compiled directly into the target are always considered.  A language compiled into static libraries linked by the target is considered if this variable is true.

If this variable is set, it should to point to a CMakeLists.txt file that will be read in by CMake after all the system settings have been set, but before they have been used.  This would allow you to override any variables that need to be changed for some language. 

.SH VARIABLES THAT CONTROL THE BUILD
.TP
.B CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX
Default filename postfix for libraries under configuration <CONFIG>.

When a non\-executable target is created its <CONFIG>_POSTFIX target property is initialized with the value of this variable if it is set.

.TP
.B CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
Where to put all the ARCHIVE targets when built.

This variable is used to initialize the ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See that target property for additional information.

.TP
.B CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
Use the install path for the RPATH

Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When the software is installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the install RPATH. If this variable is set to true then the software is always built with the install path for the RPATH and does not need to be relinked when installed.

.TP
.B CMAKE_DEBUG_POSTFIX
See variable CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX.

This variable is a special case of the more\-general CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX variable for the DEBUG configuration.

.TP
.B CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR
Automatically add the current source\- and build directories to the include path.

If this variable is enabled, CMake automatically adds in each directory ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} and ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} to the include path for this directory. These additional include directories do not propagate down to subdirectories. This is useful mainly for out\-of\-source builds, where files generated into the build tree are included by files located in the source tree.


By default CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR is OFF.

.TP
.B CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR
Mac OSX directory name for installed targets.

CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR is used to initialize the INSTALL_NAME_DIR property on all targets. See that target property for more information.

.TP

Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.

CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH is a boolean that if set to true will append directories in the linker search path and outside the project to the INSTALL_RPATH. This is used to initialize the target property INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH for all targets.

.TP
.B CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
Where to put all the LIBRARY targets when built.

This variable is used to initialize the LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See that target property for additional information.

.TP
.B CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FILE_FLAG
Flag used to link a library specified by a path to its file.

The flag used before a library file path is given to the linker.  This is needed only on very few platforms.

.TP
.B CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_FLAG
Flag used to link a library into an executable.

The flag used to specify a library to link to an executable.  On most compilers this is "\-l".

.TP
.B CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH
Do not use the builtin ELF editor to fix RPATHs on installation.

When an ELF binary needs to have a different RPATH after installation than it does in the build tree, CMake uses a builtin editor to change the RPATH in the installed copy.  If this variable is set to true then CMake will relink the binary before installation instead of using its builtin editor.

.TP
.B CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
Where to put all the RUNTIME targets when built.

This variable is used to initialize the RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY property on all the targets. See that target property for additional information.

.TP
.B CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH
Do not include RPATHs in the build tree.

Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building executables etc on systems that use RPATH. When the software is installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the install RPATH. If this variable is set to true then the software is always built with no RPATH.

.TP
.B CMAKE_USE_RELATIVE_PATHS
Use relative paths (May not work!).

If this is set to TRUE, then the CMake will use relative paths between the source and binary tree. This option does not work for more complicated projects, and relative paths are used when possible.  In general, it is not possible to move CMake generated makefiles to a different location regardless of the value of this variable.

.TP
.B EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH
Old executable location variable.

The target property RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY supercedes this variable for a target if it is set.  Executable targets are otherwise placed in this directory.

.TP
.B LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH
Old library location variable.

The target properties ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, and RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY supercede this variable for a target if they are set.  Library targets are otherwise placed in this directory.

.SH VARIABLES THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION
.PP
variables defined by cmake, that give information about the project, and cmake

.TP
.B CMAKE_AR
Name of archiving tool for static libraries.

.TP
.B CMAKE_BINARY_DIR
The path to the top level of the build tree.

.TP
.B CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL
Tool used for the actual build process.

This variable is set to the program that will be needed to build the output of CMake.   If the generator selected was Visual Studio 6, the CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM will be set to msdev, for Unix makefiles it will be set to make or gmake, and for Visual Studio 7 it set to devenv.  For Nmake Makefiles the value is nmake. This can be useful for adding special flags and commands based on the final build environment. 

.TP
.B CMAKE_CACHEFILE_DIR
The directory with the CMakeCache.txt file.

This is the full path to the directory that has the CMakeCache.txt file in it.  This is the same as CMAKE_BINARY_DIR.

.TP
.B CMAKE_CACHE_MAJOR_VERSION
Major version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file

.TP
.B CMAKE_CACHE_MINOR_VERSION
Minor version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file

This is stores the minor version of CMake used to write a CMake cache file. It is only different when a different version of CMake is run on a previously created cache file.

.TP
.B CMAKE_CACHE_PATCH_VERSION
Patch version of CMake used to create the CMakeCache.txt file

This is stores the patch version of CMake used to write a CMake cache file. It is only different when a different version of CMake is run on a previously created cache file.

.TP
.B CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR
Build\-time reference to per\-configuration output subdirectory.

For native build systems supporting multiple configurations in the build tree (such as Visual Studio and Xcode), the value is a reference to a build\-time variable specifying the name of the per\-configuration output subdirectory.  On Makefile generators this evaluates to "." because there is only one configuration in a build tree.  Example values:


.nf
  $(IntDir)        = Visual Studio 6
  $(OutDir)        = Visual Studio 7, 8, 9
  $(Configuration) = Visual Studio 10
  $(CONFIGURATION) = Xcode
  .                = Make\-based tools
.fi

Since these values are evaluated by the native build system, this variable is suitable only for use in command lines that will be evaluated at build time.  Example of intended usage:


.nf
  add_executable(mytool mytool.c)
  add_custom_command(
    OUTPUT out.txt
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool
            ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/in.txt out.txt
    DEPENDS mytool in.txt
    )
  add_custom_target(drive ALL DEPENDS out.txt)
.fi

Note that CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR is no longer necessary for this purpose but has been left for compatibility with existing projects.  Instead add_custom_command() recognizes executable target names in its COMMAND option, so "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool" can be replaced by just "mytool".


This variable is read\-only.  Setting it is undefined behavior.  In multi\-configuration build systems the value of this variable is passed as the value of preprocessor symbol "CMAKE_INTDIR" to the compilation of all source files.

.TP
.B CMAKE_COMMAND
The full path to the cmake executable.

This is the full path to the CMake executable cmake which is useful from custom commands that want to use the cmake \-E option for portable system commands. (e.g. /usr/local/bin/cmake

.TP
.B CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR
The path to the binary directory currently being processed.

This the full path to the build directory that is currently being processed by cmake.  Each directory added by add_subdirectory will create a binary directory in the build tree, and as it is being processed this variable will be set. For in\-source builds this is the current source directory being processed.

.TP
.B CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE
Full path to the listfile currently being processed.

As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this variable will always be set to the one currently being processed.  The value has dynamic scope.  When CMake starts processing commands in a source file it sets this variable to the location of the file.  When CMake finishes processing commands from the file it restores the previous value.  Therefore the value of the variable inside a macro or function is the file invoking the bottom\-most entry on the call stack, not the file containing the macro or function definition.


See also CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE.

.TP
.B CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_LINE
